I specialize in building very attractive and well-optimized websites that perform well in Google and the other search engines.  I\'m writing to see if you have web development projects that you could use  help with, whether it\'s a full website build or just a few simple modifications.   I take on clients of all shapes and sizes and we know we can help your site to perform better.  \n\nI\'d love to set up a call with you to talk about the goals for your site/business and how I can help you to achieve those goals.  Do you have time tomorrow or sometime within the next few days for a quick introduction call?  I can review goals with you and provide you with some guidance about what can be done to take your site to the next level as well as giving you a price quote on what it will take to get it done (my prices are very reasonable).  I can also provide you with information about things that have worked very well for my other clients to help them achieve their goals.  \n\nI will do my best to work with your schedule, so let me know what time works best and we\'ll set up a call, or feel free to call me at 888-311-8225.  \n\nBest Regards,\n\nJohn Hayler\nWeb Design ',	7,	NULL),

At first glance, you might think the theme is rather plain. The screenshot on the theme&#8217;s description page doesn&#8217;t indicate anything interesting going on under the hood, but something about it intrigued me enough to put it up on a test site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Nulis-screenshot.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[36133]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36136\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Nulis-screenshot.png?resize=880%2C660\" alt=\"Nulis-screenshot\" /></a></p>\n<p>Nulis includes several options built into the native customizer for adding your own header image, background, a custom logo, the ability to change the header text color, and more. Once customized, the theme looks quite a bit less plain than its screenshot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nullis-customized.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[36133]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36142\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nullis-customized.jpg?resize=1025%2C862\" alt=\"nullis-customized\" /></a></p>\n<p>The icon on the top right spins when clicked and fades in a search bar. The icon at the top left of the theme also spins and opens a hidden panel with your logo, bio, navigation menu, social links, and any custom widgets you wish to add. Everything included in the hidden panel can be added via the customizer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nulis-hidden-panel.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[36133]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36147\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nulis-hidden-panel.jpg?resize=1025%2C862\" alt=\"nulis-hidden-panel\" /></a></p>\n<p>Nulis is the Javanese word for &#8216;writing,&#8217; and the theme does an excellent job of highlighting your content, especially if you are fond of post formats. Each post format has its own unique styling to set it apart from the others. The one-column theme surrounds your content with ample white space and showcases large, full-width featured images. The theme is also responsive and looks fantastic on mobile devices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nulis-responsive.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[36133]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36144\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nulis-responsive.jpg?resize=1025%2C862\" alt=\"nulis-responsive\" /></a></p>\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"https://wp-themes.com/nulis?TB_iframe=true&width=1330&height=648\" href=\"https://wp-themes.com/nulis?TB_iframe=true&width=1330&height=648\">live demo</a> to see the theme in action, and make sure to try the interactive icons at the top while you&#8217;re there. It&#8217;s a fun addition for toggling the hidden panel and search box.</p>\n<p>Nulis was created by web developer <a href=\"http://dennykuswantoro.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Denny Kuswantoro</a>. It&#8217;s his first submission to the themes directory and his account will be one to watch in the future.

The plugin allows users to subscribe to new posts/comments via email and leave a comment by simply hitting reply. Postmatic beta 6 introduced <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/postmatic-now-supports-1-click-migration-of-subscribers-from-jetpack\" target=\"_blank\">1-click migration of subscribers from Jetpack</a>, in order to make it easy for Jetpack users to get on board.</p>\n<p>The plugin aims to make WordPress and post/comment subscription emails work seamlessly, so that users don&#8217;t have to leave their inboxes to interact with commenters. While the base plugin is free for any number of blogs and subscribers, the Postmatic creators are looking to monetize it in the future by offering paid delivery of outgoing mail for larger sites.</p>\n<p>In an effort to compete against the Jetpack-dominated comment subscription feature, Postmatic is aggressively signing up new users via its free concierge service. For a limited time, the team will perform the following for users who wish to switch to Postmatic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep things safe and back up your database</li>\n<li>Handle the nuts and bolts to get the plugin installed</li>\n<li>Customize your email template by creating a header image and assigning some handy widgets to your footer</li>\n<li>Migrate your existing users from Jetpack, Mailpoet, Mailchimp, Feedburner or other double-opt-in email or subscription service</li>\n<li>Invite your past commenters to join to subscribe so your content gets right into their inbox</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The free concierge service is limited to the first 50 people who respond by filling out Postmatic&#8217;s <a href=\"http://gopostmatic.com/concierge/\" target=\"_blank\">application</a>. If the service is successful, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see it added to the product&#8217;s commercial offerings in the near future.</p>\n<p>Comments are vital to the health of a blog and are often the strongest indicator of engagement on your content. Based on the initial response to Postmatic, WordPress users who <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/why-comments-still-matter\" target=\"_blank\">value comments</a> are eager to find better ways to extend them to boost interaction.</p>\n<p>Postmatic, like many other new products, is entering the marketplace with the strategy of building a strong user base around its free plugin. Its creators are aiming to capture a share of the post/comment subscription market with importers for Jetpack, Mailpoet, Mailchimp, Feedburner and other services before the official public launch.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 22:10:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: Menu Customizer Now in Development for WordPress 4.2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=36046\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-now-in-development-for-wordpress-4-2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3581:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hammer.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[36046]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hammer.jpg?resize=984%2C447\" alt=\"hammer\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23557\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-dinah-released\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 4.1</a> was released just yesterday, but core contributors are already planning and working towards 4.2. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-customizer/\" target=\"_blank\">Menu Customizer</a> feature plugin is back in development and contributors are hoping to have it ready for inclusion in 4.2. <a href=\"http://celloexpressions.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Halsey</a>, who originally started the Menu Customizer work as part of his Google Summer of Code project, will be leading the effort to get the feature prepared for the upcoming release.</p>\n<p>During the last release cycle, Halsey was focused on improving the Customizer API in core to add dynamic and contextual controls, sections, and panels. The Menu Customizer plugin has now been updated to be compatible with WordPress 4.1 and is ready to pick up development where it left off. As it&#8217;s no longer a GSoC project, Halsey is now <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/12/19/menu-customizer-call-for-contributors/\" target=\"_blank\">actively looking for contributors</a>.</p>\n<p>Currently, the menu customizer is usable and offers the ability to assign menus to locations, edit existing menus/menu items, and add new menus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/menu-customizer.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[36046]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/menu-customizer.png?resize=1025%2C570\" alt=\"menu-customizer\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36056\" /></a></p>\n<p>Halsey outlined a roadmap for preparing the Menu Customizer for merge, which includes a number of PHP and Javascript development tasks, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build-out the core API for adding Customizer sections and controls entirely with JavaScript, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30741\" target=\"_blank\">#30741</a> and its related tickets (PHP, JS)</li>\n<li>Drag and Drop menu item reordering needs to do sub-menus (code imported from nav-menus.php is commented out in menu-customizer.js currently) (JS)</li>\n<li>Fix problems with previewing updates to menu items, and with previewing newly-added menus once items are added (JS)</li>\n<li>Redo the add-menu-items “panel” to lazy-load its contents &#038; utilize Backbone sub-views (PHP, JS)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He also hopes to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28784\" target=\"_blank\">improve the experience of using the customizer on mobile</a>, followed by getting the menu customizer plugin to work on mobile.

During the December 17th <a title=\"https://assoc.drupal.org/about/meet\" href=\"https://assoc.drupal.org/about/meet\">Drupal Association meeting</a>, the team announced it&#8217;s going to redesign Drupal.org user profiles and released a concept image.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DrupalUserProfileConcept.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[36012]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-36014\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DrupalUserProfileConcept.png?resize=1025%2C1321\" alt=\"Drupal User Profile Page Redesign Concept\" /></a>Drupal User Profile Page Redesign Concept\n<p>The proposed design will change slightly as members of the community <a title=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2281763\" href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2281763\">continue to work on it</a>, but I like what I see so far. It&#8217;s clean, uses colors, and does a good job of organizing a lot of information.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the WordPress.org user profiles which are <strong>also</strong> a work in progress, don&#8217;t show nearly as much information. Activity, Plugins, and Favorites are split into sections. However, the main profile page looks nice, uses color, and contains badges.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WordPressorgOttoProfile.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[36012]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-36016\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WordPressorgOttoProfile.png?resize=991%2C537\" alt=\"WordPress.org User Profile Pages\" /></a>WordPress.org User Profile Pages\n<h2>Difference in Approach</h2>\n<p>One of the differences between WordPress and Drupal is that <a title=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2281763\" href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2281763\">the ticket</a> dedicated to redesigning Drupal user profile pages is filled with discussion and contributions. On the other hand, WordPress uses a <a title=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=!closed&component=Profiles\" href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=!closed&component=Profiles\">mixture of tickets</a>, <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/02/25/profiles-how-do-you-use-them-or-want-to/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/02/25/profiles-how-do-you-use-them-or-want-to/\">posts on the Make Community P2 website</a>, and comments to decide how to redesign the profile pages. I&#8217;m a fan of keeping information about a specific feature in a central location as it&#8217;s easier to reference.</p>\n<p>User profiles are a common item shared between two large, open source projects. It&#8217;s interesting to see the approach each has taken towards improving the design and showcasing a user&#8217;s contributions to the project.</p>\n<p>What do you think of the concept image and is there anything in the design you think would work well for WordPress.org user profiles?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 00:39:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Critical Git Vulnerability Patched: Update Your Git Clients Immediately\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=35990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"http://wptavern.com/critical-git-vulnerability-patched-update-your-git-clients-immediately\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2605:\"<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/git-logo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35990]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/git-logo.png?resize=910%2C380\" alt=\"photo credit: git - the simple guide\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14763\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">git &#8211; the simple guide</a>\n<p>Git just announced <a href=\"http://git-blame.blogspot.com.es/2014/12/git-1856-195-205-214-and-221-and.html\" target=\"_blank\">version 2.2.1</a>, a maintenance release that includes a security fix for a critical vulnerability that affects those using Windows and Mac OS X Git clients. This update also includes new releases with the same security fix for older Git versions.</p>\n<p>GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/1938-vulnerability-announced-update-your-git-clients\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> that GitHub for Windows and GitHub for Mac are both affected and should be updated immediately. The GitHub engineering team explains how attackers might exploit the vulnerability:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The vulnerability concerns Git and Git-compatible clients that access Git repositories in a case-insensitive or case-normalizing filesystem. An attacker can craft a malicious Git tree that will cause Git to ovewrite its own .git/config file when cloning or checking out a repository, leading to arbitrary command execution in the client machine. Git clients running on OS X (HFS+) or any version of Microsoft Windows (NTFS, FAT) are exploitable through this vulnerability. Linux clients are not affected if they run in a case-sensitive filesystem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using GitHub&#8217;s client for <a href=\"https://windows.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows</a> or <a href=\"https://mac.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mac</a>, the security issue has been patched and is ready for download. This includes an update to both the desktop application and the bundled version of the Git command-line client. If you&#8217;re using any other kind of Git client or software that connects to Git repositories, you&#8217;ll want to update immediately.</p>\n<p>Although the issue should not affect Linux users, the release announcement encourages those who operate hosting services with users that fetch from Windows or Mac OS X machines to update in order to protect users with older versions of Git.

His Jekyll-powered blog is hosted on <a href=\"http://ben.balter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>, along with his <a href=\"https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter\" target=\"_blank\">exporter plugin</a>, which has been in development for more than a year. It was recently updated to be even easier to use and is now available on WordPress.org.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>Want to move from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordPress\">@WordPress</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jekyllrb\">@jekyllrb</a>? The native, one-click exporter got a big refresh; now in plugin directory <a href=\"https://t.co/tUWrOe9Tn4\">https://t.co/tUWrOe9Tn4</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Ben Balter (@BenBalter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenBalter/status/543442743197179904\">December 12, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The one-click plugin converts all posts, pages, taxonomies, metadata, and settings to Markdown and YAML, which can be dropped right into Jekyll.</p>\n<h3>Who Needs a Jekyll Exporter?</h3>\n<p>I think WordPress is the best blogging software out there, but there are some bloggers who don&#8217;t want the hassle of comment moderation and all the maintenance that WordPress requires. This plugin is perfect for conveniently transitioning to Jekyll.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also useful if you have created a bunch of documentation for a project on your WordPress site but decide to move the docs to a freely hosted Jekyll-powered site on GitHub Pages. This allows you to manage your documentation with version control and makes it easy for others to contribute.</p>\n<p>I have not found Jekyll terribly easy to set up when I&#8217;ve worked with it in the past. That&#8217;s why this exporter plugin is a huge time saver &#8211; it basically does everything for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Converts all posts, pages, and settings from WordPress for use in Jekyll</li>\n<li>Export what your users see, not what the database stores (runs post content through the_content filter prior to export, allowing third-party plugins to modify the output)</li>\n<li>Converts all post_content to Markdown Extra (using Markdownify)</li>\n<li>Converts all post_meta and fields within the wp_posts table to YAML front matter for parsing by Jekyll</li>\n<li>Generates a _config.yml with all settings in the wp_options table</li>\n<li>Outputs a single zip file with _config.yml, pages, and _posts folder containing .md files for each post in the proper Jekyll naming convention</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Jekyll Exporter plugin has no settings to configure. Just click the button and you&#8217;ll have all your content exported into the correct format for Jekyll and organized into the right structure.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble with your server timing out on the export, Balter has ensured that the plugin is compatible with WP-CLI. You can run this command, which also has support for sites where wp-content isn&#8217;t in the traditional location:</p>\n<p><code>wp jekyll-export &gt; export.zip</code></p>\n<p>Currently, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/\" target=\"_blank\">Jekyll Exporter</a> is the only one of its kind in the WordPress.org plugin directory. Fortunately, it was created by a reputable developer who knows the ins and outs of using Jekyll after WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 21:33:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"Post Status: WordPress 4.1, “Dinah”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"http://www.poststat.us/?p=7245\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-4-1-dinah/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7656:\"<p><img src=\"http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wordpress-4-1-752x300.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-4-1\" width=\"627\" height=\"250\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7247\" /><br />\nWordPress 4.1, &#8220;Dinah&#8221;, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2014/12/dinah/\">has just been released</a>. WordPress 4.1 is the result of months of work and includes a number of excellent new features.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.1 was led by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnbillion\">John Blackbourn</a>, who did an outstanding job. Two hundred and eighty three contributors were part of WordPress 4.1, which Matt Mullenweg states is a new high.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the new features.</p>\n<h3>Persistent Distraction-free Writing</h3>\n<p>I must begin with the new persistent Distraction-free Writing feature, as I&#8217;m using it to write this very post. We&#8217;ve had Distraction-free Writing since 2011, with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2011/07/gershwin/\">release of WordPress 3.2</a>. However, it&#8217;s always been a single-experience decision. You hit the button to enter distraction free mode, and you utilize it for a single writing session.<span id=\"more-7245\"></span></p>\n<p>Now, the button itself is persistent, and the experience of writing distraction free doesn&#8217;t enter a new screen, but rather fade away the distractions of the default editor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cqbFU6CSqm2\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/Gya2WLi5yP-900x900.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot\" width=\"900\" height=\"585\" /></a></p>\n<p>The left admin seamlessly floats away, as do the metaboxes to the right of and below the editor. The editor itself remains, versus using a modified editor like before.</p>\n<p>When you update to WordPress 4.1, you are triggered with a note about Distraction-free Writing, and now that it&#8217;s a decision you only have to make once, I think this feature will finally get the broad use it deserves. It really is much more pleasant to write without everything else around you, to be lost in your thoughts as they make their way to the editor.</p>\n<h3>Twenty Fifteen theme</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cgjoFpPJvYk\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/RA_QnzIQ8P-2000x2000.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot\" width=\"877\" height=\"651\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Twenty Fifteen theme is the finest work I&#8217;ve seen yet of the default theme team. A blogging, and personal, theme &#8212; Twenty Fifteen is simple, with beautiful typography, and capable of showcasing blog posts of any format with poise.</p>\n<p>Twenty Fifteen comes in six base color schemes: default (light), dark, yellow, ping, purple, and blue. It also supports WordPress&#8217; background and header image features, and allows you to customize colors from your base selection; Twenty Fifteen can be as quirky as you are.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cFEI4yyaDmU\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/fRQdHcxeXD-900x900.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot\" width=\"900\" height=\"555\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the <a href=\"http://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/\">default theme demo</a>, as well as it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen\">new page on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n<h3>Dozens of languages, available any time</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/ckbOnTY71Gq\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/UqYmETHq8L-900x900.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot\" width=\"901\" height=\"733\" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress has made tremendous progress for non-English speaking users in the past few releases. With WordPress 4.0, you could choose a language on installation, whereas before it required many more steps. Now the team has gone a step further, so that language can be changed at any time, right from WordPress&#8217; general settings page.</p>\n<p>Given that <a href=\"http://www.poststat.us/understand-wordpress-internationalization-translation/\">a third of WordPress installs are non-English</a> (and if I recall correctly half of new downloads are non-English now), this change further reduces the barrier of language in publishing software, and is an excellent move for the progression of the platform across the world.</p>\n<h3>Recommended plugins</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cQi9LX744H8\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/r3jaQ2VeCP-900x900.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot\" width=\"900\" height=\"674\" /></a></p>\n<p>I believe recommended plugins is probably the most controversial feature in WordPress 4.1, though it is not without precedent. &#8220;Featured&#8221; themes have been in the WordPress dashboard for a while now. But with a tab for recommended plugins, now users can see plugin recommendations based on plugins already installed and plugins other sites have installed.</p>\n<p>Recommended plugins are replacing the former popular plugins tab, and is mostly a change in the underlying API for showing the plugins themselves. Since it&#8217;s not a manual recommendation, I think this is a good change, and will more accurately help folks find relevant plugins than just listing the most popular plugins in the directory.</p>\n<h3>New template tags and theming tools</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to using some of the new template tags introduced in WordPress 4.1.</p>\n<p>My favorite is <code>get_the_archive_title()</code>. Themers out there all know about the big blob of conditionals in most theme archive templates to spit out the right string based on which archive template it is. Now, there&#8217;s a function for that, and it&#8217;s fully filterable to boot.</p>\n<p>Descriptions of the new title functions, some new pagination functions, and some particularly nice body class assignment enhancements are well described on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/12/04/new-template-tags-in-4-1/\">this Make WordPress post</a> by Konstantin Obenland. There&#8217;s also a post about adding theme support to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/29/title-tags-in-4-1/\">let WordPress handle title tags</a>, which is a handy thing.</p>\n<h3>Log out from anywhere</h3>\n<p>A relatively small but nice security feature is the new ability to log out of all installs from a single location. WordPress uses cookies to keep you logged into your install for a period of time. Well, if you ever leave yourself logged in on a computer you don&#8217;t trust, you can now log out of all instances easily, from your profile page on an install.</p>\n<p>There is a new button that says &#8220;Log Out of All Other Sessions,&#8221; and also tells you if you are logged in at more than one location.</p>\n<h3>More improvements to queries</h3>\n<p>I love how much progress has been made on the WordPress query tools in the last couple of years. WordPress 4.1 introduces the ability for a nested query syntax, which makes more complex queries possible for <code>WP_Tax_Query</code>, <code>WP_Date_Query</code>, and <code>WP_Meta_Query</code>. I don&#8217;t often call out single individual&#8217;s work on something, but Boone Georges <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29822\">really</a> <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29738\">slayed</a> <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29642\">it</a> with the nested queries work. He wrote about it <a href=\"http://teleogistic.net/2014/12/wordpress-4-1-and-me/\">on his blog in detail</a>.</p>\n<h3>More under the hood</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.1 includes many other under the hood features you should check out on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.1\">Codex page about the release</a>.</p>\n<h3>More excellent progress for WordPress</h3>\n<p>WordPress is better than ever, and hundreds (or thousands) of people make it so. Great job everyone. Now, go download WordPress 4.1.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 19:12:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.1 “Dinah” Released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=35700\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-dinah-released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7758:\"<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dinah.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35700]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35977\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dinah.jpg?resize=1025%2C502\" alt=\"photo credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Image\" /></a>photo credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Image\n<p>After nearly four months of development, WordPress 4.1 &#8220;Dinah&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinah_Washington\">Dinah Washington</a>, is <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2014/12/wordpress-4-1-dinah/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2014/12/wordpress-4-1-dinah/\">available for download</a>. Led by<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead\"> John Blackbourn</a>, 4.1 contains several improvements such as a new default theme, an improved distraction free writing experience, and plugin recommendations.</p>\n<h2>Twenty Fifteen</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/TwentyFifteenDefaultTheme.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35700]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35706\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/TwentyFifteenDefaultTheme.png?resize=830%2C518\" alt=\"New Default Theme For 2015\" /></a>New Default Theme For 2015\n<p>Twenty Fifteen is a two-column theme with a focus on content. In sharp contrast to <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfourteen\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfourteen\">Twenty Fourteen</a>, Twenty Fifteen is light in color with a left hand sidebar and content in the right column. It&#8217;s designed with a mobile first approach and looks great on various screen sizes. Twenty Fifteen looks best when using large, featured images. It also ships with five different color schemes, ranging from dark to pink that are accessible from within the theme customizer.</p>\n<h2>Plugin Recommendations</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/RecommendedPluginsTab.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35700]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35318\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/RecommendedPluginsTab.png?resize=1025%2C527\" alt=\"Plugins Recommended To Me Based on Data of Sites with Similar Plugins Installed\" /></a>Plugins Recommended To Me Based on Data of Sites with Similar Plugins Installed\n<p>When you browse to the Add New plugins screen, you&#8217;ll see a new Recommended tab. Recommendations are based on data from thousands of WordPress sites about plugins that are commonly used together. It&#8217;s similar to an online store&#8217;s &#8220;people who bought this also bought this&#8221; feature.  Because of the strict data set used, plugins that are 3-4 years old or older won&#8217;t be recommended.</p>\n<h2>Improved Distraction Free Writing</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DistractionFreeWriting41.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35700]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35707\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DistractionFreeWriting41.png?resize=1025%2C501\" alt=\"Distraction Free Writing in WordPress 4.1\" /></a>Distraction Free Writing in WordPress 4.1\n<p>When you enable Distraction Free Writing mode, the surrounding interface disappears as you type leaving important actions and menu items just a mouse movement away. This mode minimizes distractions without having to go through a clunky transition to access the admin menu or meta boxes. To bring back the menu and meta boxes, move the mouse cursor to the left or right of the editor.</p>\n<h2>Log Out of Every Session With One Button</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WordPressSessionUI.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35700]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35708\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WordPressSessionUI.png?resize=982%2C357\" alt=\"WordPress Session UI\" /></a>WordPress Session UI\n<p>WordPress 4.1 includes a new Session UI. The UI shows up on the profile page when WordPress detects more than one active session. When pressed, the button logs out of every session except for the active one. This is useful for those times when users might have forgotten to log off from a laptop, phone, or public computer.</p>\n<h2>Inline Image Editing</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/InlineImageEditing.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35700]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35709\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/InlineImageEditing.png?resize=681%2C386\" alt=\"Inline Image Editing Tools\" /></a>Inline Image Editing Tools\n<p>When editing an image using the Visual editor, a set of inline editing tools appear above the image. These tools provide a quick and easy way to align an image or access additional editing options.</p>\n<h2>oEmbed Support Added For Vine</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.1 has<a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\"> oEmbed support</a> for <a title=\"https://vine.co\" href=\"https://vine.co\">Vine</a> which hosts short videos that continuously loop. Sharing a Vine is now as easy as copying and pasting the URL into the Visual editor.</p>\n<h2>Choose a Different Language at Any Time</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SiteLanguageWordPress4.1.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35700]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35711\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SiteLanguageWordPress4.1.png?resize=637%2C450\" alt=\"Site Language Picker in WordPress 4.1\" /></a>Site Language Picker in WordPress 4.1\n<p>You can now choose a language for your site at any time by visiting the General Settings screen. Choosing a different language installs the required <a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language\">language pack</a>.</p>\n<h2>Developer Items</h2>\n<p>Metadata, date, and term queries now support <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/20/update-on-query-improvements-in-4-1/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/20/update-on-query-improvements-in-4-1/\">advanced conditional logic</a>, like nested clauses and multiple operators. There are a couple of <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/12/04/new-template-tags-in-4-1/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/12/04/new-template-tags-in-4-1/\">new Template tags</a> and a major improvement with <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-to-introduce-theme-support-for-the-title-tag\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-to-introduce-theme-support-for-the-title-tag\">Title Tags</a> in 4.1. There have also been several <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/27/toward-a-complete-javascript-api-for-the-customizer/\">improvements to the Customizer API</a>, including contextual panels, sections, and JavaScript templates for controls.</p>\n<h2>4.1 Represents Continued Improvement</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.1 is the product of dedicated developers and 283 contributors. The ability to choose a language without having to touch a line of code is a great improvement. The default theme is refreshing compared to Twenty Fourteen and users have an entire year to manipulate the design.

The pulse is around 98 Bytes in size, but it can cause performance issues in certain situations.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been notified by your webhost that your account is using too many resources and cite <code>POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php</code> as the cause, it&#8217;s likely due to the Heartbeat API.</p>\n<h2>How The Heartbeat API Works</h2>\n<p>Inmotion Hosting has an <a title=\"http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/heartbeat-ajax-php-usage#heartbeat-in-action\" href=\"http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/heartbeat-ajax-php-usage#heartbeat-in-action\">excellent article</a> that explains how the Heartbeat API works. If you monitor server requests while in the post editor, you&#8217;ll see <code>POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php \"http://example.com/wp-admin/index.php</code> appear every 15 seconds. This is the pulse generated by the API.</p>\n<p>The pulse makes sure you have a persistent connection to the web server and provides a way for developers to trigger events. For example, if the pulse takes 30 seconds or longer to process, WordPress displays a connection error and attempts to reconnect to the server.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PulseExecutionTime.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35865]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35883\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PulseExecutionTime.png?resize=221%2C183\" alt=\"Execution Time\" /></a>Execution Time\n<p>There are several situations in which a pulse is generated either automatically, or by a user. Most of the time pulses are harmless and don&#8217;t do anything.</p>\n<p>Each pulse (POST request) executes a PHP script equating to CPU time on the server. In an experiment, InMotion Hosting left the dashboard open for a half hour and noticed <strong>25</strong> PHP script executions that used <strong>5.77</strong> CPU seconds. The small amount of CPU time was used to do nothing.</p>\n<p>The problem is compounded by the fact that each user who has access to the backend of WordPress generates a pulse. As the number of users navigating the WordPress backend simultaneously increases, so does the number of pulses generated from the API.</p>\n<p>If a webhosting provider has strict limits on the number of processes or resources used, you could easily go over the limit.</p>\n<h2>How to Control The Heartbeat API</h2>\n<p><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/heartbeat-control/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/heartbeat-control/\">Heartbeat Control</a>, developed by <a title=\"http://jeffmatson.net/\" href=\"http://jeffmatson.net/\">Jeff Matson</a>, is a new plugin that enables you to control the interval of pulses. After activating the plugin, you&#8217;ll find the settings located in <strong>Tools&gt;Heartbeat Control</strong>.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/HeartbeatControlSettings.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35865]\"><img class=\"wp-image-35885 size-full\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/HeartbeatControlSettings.png?resize=502%2C258\" alt=\"Heartbeat Control Settings\" /></a>Heartbeat Control Settings\n<p>You can choose to disable the API entirely, only on the dashboard page, or allow it only on the post editing screen. You can also choose the interval when pulses are sent. The choices range from 15-60 seconds with 5 second intervals in between.</p>\n<p>By changing the interval to 60 seconds, pulses are less likely to impact server performance. Several <a title=\"http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/heartbeat-ajax-php-usage#comments\" href=\"http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/heartbeat-ajax-php-usage#comments\">HostGator customers</a> who use the plugin report they no longer experience suspensions for using too many resources.</p>\n<h2>Why InMotion Hosting Doesn&#8217;t Throttle The API by Default</h2>\n<p>If increasing the pulse interval from 15 to 60 seconds increases server performance, why doesn&#8217;t InMotion Hosting throttle the API on every webhosting server?</p>\n<p>Matson, who works for InMotion Hosting, says a one size fits all approach doesn&#8217;t work. &#8220;The reason we don&#8217;t do that is because there are some users that require it at the default rate or an even higher frequency. When making server-wide changes, you have to be extremely careful that you do not impact a customer&#8217;s site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matson goes on to say that, &#8220;As a host, the number one goal is making customers happy and restricting the normal operation of a user&#8217;s site is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>How HostGator Almost Deleted WP Tavern</h2>\n<p>I sympathize with those who use HostGator as they have a strict <a title=\"http://support.hostgator.com/articles/pre-sales-policies/rules-terms-of-service/cpu-resource-restriction\" href=\"http://support.hostgator.com/articles/pre-sales-policies/rules-terms-of-service/cpu-resource-restriction\">CPU resource restriction</a>. If pulses from the Heartbeat API cause the CPU to become busy or cause a backup in processes, using 25% of the CPU longer than 90 seconds is easy to do.</p>\n<p>HostGator&#8217;s policy for using too many resources is to suspend the account. This makes it impossible to troubleshoot the problem. If you exceed the resource allotment more than five times, the site is removed from the server and your account is banned.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/HostGatorResourcePolicy.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35865]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35886\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/HostGatorResourcePolicy.png?resize=503%2C107\" alt=\"HostGator Resource Policy\" /></a>HostGator Resource Policy\n<p>In late 2013, when WP Tavern used HostGator, I experienced first-hand what it&#8217;s like to have a website suspended. When I upgraded the Tavern to WordPress 3.6, which introduced the Heartbeat API, I <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/my-wordpress-is-denying-itself-service\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/my-wordpress-is-denying-itself-service\">started to experience problems</a>. The site would routinely lock up and when I viewed the processes tab in cPanel, it looked like a simple process repeated itself, leading to a denial of service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/siteoffline.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35865]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7554\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/siteoffline.jpg?resize=741%2C644\" alt=\"Site Offline Errors\" /></a>I can&#8217;t confirm if the Heartbeat API was the culprit but it&#8217;s high on my list of suspicions. After suspending the Tavern twice, HostGator informed me that if the site was suspended again, it would be removed from the server without giving me a chance to back it up. Needless to say, I switched hosts immediately.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t End Up in a Similar Situation</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a webhosting service with strict resource limits, consider installing Heartbeat Control to limit the number of pulses. Not only will it mean fewer calls to the server, but it may lead to a performance increase as well. Keep a close eye on the resources used and if you come close to maxing out, it&#8217;s a sign you need to upgrade to a better plan. Don&#8217;t end up in a position where you may lose your site!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 02:19:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Atlanta WordPress Coders Guild: A New Meetup for Designers and Programmers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=35847\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"http://wptavern.com/atlanta-wordpress-coders-guild-a-new-meetup-for-designers-and-programmers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7495:\"<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/atlanta.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35847]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35874\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/atlanta.jpg?resize=1022%2C496\" alt=\"photo credit: FrenchKheldar - cc\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/frenchkheldar/3322197028/\">FrenchKheldar</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>The Atlanta metro area will soon be getting a new type of WordPress meetup, targeted towards programmers and designers. Local organizers <a href=\"http://mikeschinkel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Schinkel</a> and <a href=\"http://micahwood.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Micah Wood</a> announced the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/atlanta-wordpress-coders-guild/\" target=\"_blank\">Atlanta WordPress Coders Guild</a> on Meetup.com and have already attracted 55 members who identify themselves as coders.</p>\n<p>Due to the group&#8217;s unique requirements, it is not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation-sponsored <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/\" target=\"_blank\">community meetups</a>. In order to become a member, one must be interested in working with technologies such as PHP, MySQL, Apache, Javascript, jQuery, Git, Backbone, Vagrant, Gulp, Grunt, SASS, and the WordPress API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation&#8217;s Community Meetups initiative because we are not open to WordPress end-users,&#8221; Schinkel emphasizes in the meetup&#8217;s description. &#8220;We are instead a group for serious professionals with a goal of raising the bar for WordPress coder talent in the Southeast and to make it more viable for the major project funders to choose WordPress instead of closed source solutions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Official community meetups have a requirement to have membership open to &#8220;all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status or any other criteria.&#8221; Since the Atlanta WordPress Coders Guild isn&#8217;t open to all skill levels, it is running independently. The organizers plan to host workshops centered around best practices expected by clients who spend $100k+ on projects that demand a high level of performance and security.</p>\n<h3>Atlanta&#8217;s Fragmented WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>Schinkel has lived in the Atlanta area for several decades and has a great deal of experience <a href=\"http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/25-best-practices-for-meetup-organizers/\" target=\"_blank\">organizing professional meetups</a>. He&#8217;s an accidental connector who became acquainted with many people in the area and has a unique perspective on the Atlanta tech and WordPress communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a really strong tech community backed by education like Georgia Tech and ~10 Fortune 500 companies in the Atlanta area, and tons on technology meetups,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lots of Java, .NET, Ruby, Javascript and PHP, and at least 10 large digital agencies with probably up to 1000 agencies if you count the small ones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The startup community is also thriving in the area and Atlanta is experiencing growth across various sectors, including financial, health tech, IT security, and more. Unfortunately, this has not directly translated into a strong WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress community, however, is fragmented because of metro Atlanta’s expansive geography, lack of any natural geographic boundaries and no single entity with the clout to really organize a cohesive community,&#8221; Schinkel explained. The area has 10 different meetups, many of which fail to attract more than a handful of members on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/wordpress-atlanta/\" target=\"_blank\">Atlanta WordPress Users Group</a>, organized by Judi Knight, is the most successful with approximately 1600 members, but Schinkel says those are primarily people willing to travel to a meetup in town. Outer metro Atlanta residents are reluctant to attend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, from the perspective of a professional WordPress PHP, MySQL and jQuery coder, those meetups are characterized by really novice end-users,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Rarely, if ever, is there any significant WordPress coding talent in attendance, and intermediate to advanced topics are never announced or covered.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Need for More Workshops Focused on Advanced Topics</h3>\n<p>Schinkel believes that the Atlanta WordPress community needs the opportunity to have more advanced workshops and developer-focused meetups. &#8220;As far as I can tell the existing successful WordPress meetups all focus on the needs of end-users,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That’s great, it is what in part has driven the success of WordPress, but it also means that there are no local meetups to help WordPress coders to grow their skills.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schinkel used the term &#8220;coder&#8221; in the meetup name specifically to filter out those he would classify as developers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many people think of themselves as &#8216;WordPress Developers&#8217; when what they do is install WordPress; select, install and configure a theme; select, install and configure plugins; maybe tweak CSS; and add some page templates with a bit if loop and template tag coding. So we think of those people as &#8216;Site Builders&#8217; and think the term &#8216;developer&#8217; is too broadly adopted to have any communicable distinction in the context of WordPress people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are a myriad of meetups in Atlanta for WordPress end users who want to learn about using themes and plugins, but virtually no meetups for coders who want to expand their skills. This is why the organizers are spearheading a WordPress coders guild in Atlanta.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First and foremost we want to see more Atlanta agencies and internal teams in the larger Atlanta organizations choosing WordPress for their projects,&#8221; Schinkel said. &#8220;For that to happen there has to be a stronger talent base in Atlanta who are knowledgeable and experienced in WordPress best practices, at least as far as they relate to agency use of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He anticipates that the group will probably have its first &#8220;get to know each other&#8221; meetup in January and then start workshops in February. With advanced topics in the spotlight every week, Schinkel hopes that agencies and internal teams that rarely come out to network will be more motivated to attend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to create a stronger WP coder community than we currently have in Atlanta, and the one we currently have is really lacking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Put it another way, Drupal has a far stronger developer community in Atlanta because of their Drupal meetup and yet Drupal has ~1/10th the marketshare of WordPress. Now that is really sad, don’t you think?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schinkel and Wood have identified a common problem with many community meetups where the topics focus on end user education. While connecting with people of all skill levels is important, more advanced WordPress professionals often become less motivated to attend meetups that don&#8217;t include topics that challenge them and help them become better at their work. The <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/atlanta-wordpress-coders-guild/\" target=\"_blank\">Atlanta WordPress Coders Guild</a> aims to solve this problem with an alternative, non-traditional WordPress meetup.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 23:34:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: VVV-Dashboard Provides an Interface for Managing Varying Vagrant Vagrants Installations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=35807\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"http://wptavern.com/vvv-dashboard-provides-an-interface-for-managing-varying-vagrant-vagrants-installations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3392:\"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leogopal/VVV-Dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">VVV-Dashboard</a> is a new tool that provides an interface for managing your <a href=\"https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV\" target=\"_blank\">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a> installations. Inspired by <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/variable-vvv-a-new-vvv-site-creation-wizard-for-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Variable VVV</a>, a script that makes it easy to create and delete sites, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leogopal\" target=\"_blank\">Leo Gopal</a> made VVV-Dashboard to complement it.</p>\n<p>Gopal is a WordPress developer from Cape Town, South Africa. &#8220;I installed my first WordPress site seven years ago while in high school and started creating sites for clients ever since. Only recently, after Matt&#8217;s <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/\" target=\"_blank\">Five for the Future</a> speech, did I decide to come out and offer what I have to everyone, more freely,&#8221; he said. VVV-Dashboard is one of his first public contributions.</p>\n<p>The tool was designed to work with Variable VVV but can be used without it. &#8220;Because VVV is very terminal oriented, it&#8217;s easy to forget commands when you need them. For example, you might forget to &#8216;vagrant up &#8211;provision&#8217; when working with Variable VVV (and other site creators),&#8221; Gopal said. VVV-Dashboard adds a quick reference page inside your vvv.dev site for commands and includes a list of all your Vagrant installs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vvv-dashboard.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35807]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vvv-dashboard.png?resize=1025%2C472\" alt=\"vvv-dashboard\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-35817\" /></a></p>\n<p>The title of the page displays how many VVV sites you have installed on your machine. Each site and its admin are linked, along with a <a href=\"http://www.xdebug.org/docs/profiler\" target=\"_blank\">profiler</a> button that offers a quick overview. In order for the profiler to work, you must have Xdebug turned on.</p>\n<p>Many developers end up with a long list of dev sites, and it can be difficult to remember what sites are active and where they are located. The VVV-Dashboard interface saves you time with a convenient list and might even inspire you to perform a cleanup of sites no longer in use.</p>\n<p>In the next few releases, Gopal plans to include more basic site info in the dashboard, such as whether or not WP_Debug is enabled, an indicator for if Xdebug is on/off, the current active theme, etc. Variable VVV recently added a blueprints feature, which allows you to set up different plugins, themes, mu-plugins, options, or constants that will be installed to a new site you create. Gopal plans to create a few blueprint examples and add them to VVV-Dashboard.</p>\n<p>VVV-Dashboard is licensed under the GPL V2. It adds a friendly layer between you and your VVV sites to make management more convenient and efficient.

Users can browse the directory for newest, recently updated, most popular, and highest rated plugins. With the exception of the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/updated/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/updated/\">recently updated</a> category, there&#8217;s no way to discover plugins in the middle of the pack. A new <a title=\"https://managewp.org/plugins/best\" href=\"https://managewp.org/plugins/best\">plugin discovery tool</a> by ManageWP, attempts to solve the problem.</p>\n<h2>Algorithm Based</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ManageWPBestNewPlugins.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35747]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35794\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ManageWPBestNewPlugins.png?resize=925%2C663\" alt=\"Best New Plugins\" /></a>Best New Plugins Page\n<p>The front page of <a title=\"https://managewp.org/plugins/best\" href=\"https://managewp.org/plugins/best\">ManageWP.org/plugins</a> displays the best new plugins under 100k downloads. The plugins are determined using an algorithm that takes into account plugin quality and acceleration of growth. A plugin&#8217;s quality is determined using seven metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last Updated</li>\n<li>WordPress Compatibility</li>\n<li>Support</li>\n<li>Rating</li>\n<li>Plugin Popularity</li>\n<li>Author Popularity</li>\n<li>Other plugins from the same author</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using a combination of metrics, ManageWP is able to display a constantly evolving list of <a title=\"https://managewp.org/plugins/rising\" href=\"https://managewp.org/plugins/rising\"><em>rising stars</em></a>. Placing emphasis on a plugin&#8217;s compatibility with WordPress and when it was last updated might motivate plugin authors to keep these fields updated.</p>\n<h2>Comparing Plugins</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious to see how plugins compare to each other, check out the <a title=\"https://managewp.org/#comparePlugins\" href=\"https://managewp.org/#comparePlugins\">plugin comparison section</a> of the site. Simply choose two different plugins and hit the compare button. The comparison displays each plugin&#8217;s statistics with a download chart at the bottom. At the moment, you&#8217;re limited to comparing only two plugins at the same time, but there are plans to allow for more in the future.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ManageWPPluginComparison.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35747]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35793\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ManageWPPluginComparison.png?resize=915%2C493\" alt=\"Plugin Comparisons\" /></a>Plugin Comparisons\n<h2>Plugin Awards</h2>\n<p>Awards are a quick way to determine how well a plugin is doing in specific categories. For example, <a title=\"https://managewp.org/plugins/details/wordpress-seo\" href=\"https://managewp.org/plugins/details/wordpress-seo\">WordPress SEO</a> by Team Yoast, has a number of awards for being the most downloaded and highest rated in multiple categories. I think it would be beneficial if this area was extended to highlight more ranks like top ten, top five, and number one.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PluginAwards.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35747]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35797\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PluginAwards.png?resize=599%2C559\" alt=\"ManageWP Plugin Awards\" /></a>ManageWP Plugin Awards\n<h2>Future Improvements</h2>\n<p>ManageWP founder, Vladimir Prelovac, says he&#8217;s not finished with the site. In <a title=\"https://managewp.com/blog\" href=\"https://managewp.com/blog\">the announcement</a>, he shares a couple of ideas on what he&#8217;d like to see in the next iteration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simpler plugin comparison, allow multiple plugins compared at once.</li>\n<li>Include <a href=\"https://wpvulndb.com/\">WP Vulnerability Database</a> security data to plugin details page and Plugin Quality score.</li>\n<li>Allow plugin authors to ‘claim’ their pages. This will allow all sorts of activity like adding the links to their premium support, answering Q&amp;A</li>\n<li>Open everything via an API so everyone can use the engine and its data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The WP Vulnerability Database will be a nice enhancement, especially if you can see how many vulnerability reports a plugin has. Something to keep in mind is that ManageWP/Plugins is utilizing the <a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API\">WordPress.org Plugins API,</a> which limits the types of data it&#8217;s able to work with.</p>\n<h2>A Plugin Directory Without The Plugins</h2>\n<p>I love the idea behind <a title=\"https://managewp.org/plugins\" href=\"https://managewp.org/plugins\">ManageWP/Plugins</a> because it fills a void created by the plugin directory. It&#8217;s essentially a sub-section of the directory without the plugins. When I look for plugins to review, the directory leaves me little choice between one that&#8217;s popular or brand new. ManageWP/Plugins gives me an opportunity to discover them before they reach global popularity.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 05:58:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"WPTavern: WordPress Accessibility Team Is Mobilizing to Make Accessibility Required for WordPress.org Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=35570\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-is-mobilizing-to-make-accessibility-required-for-wordpress-org-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4368:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/guided-road.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35570]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22575\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/guided-road.jpg?resize=900%2C421\" alt=\"guided-road\" /></a></p>\n<p>Throughout the first half of this month, the WordPress Accessibility team has been working together with the Theme Review Team to discuss the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2014/12/04/theme-accessibility-meeting-notes/\" target=\"_blank\">possibility of requiring the accessibility-ready tag</a> for themes hosted on WordPress.org. The team will need to create an official proposal to submit to the Theme Review Team in order to make this happen.</p>\n<p>In preparation, the Accessibility team is increasing efforts to educate theme authors on accessibility best practices. Joe Dolson published a post with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/12/15/three-easy-tips-for-accessible-theming/\" target=\"_blank\">tips for making WordPress themes accessible</a>, which includes basic instructions for making themes work with a keyboard, creating event triggers as accessible controls, and adding supporting text for images.</p>\n<p>The Accessibility team also created a <a href=\"https://github.com/wpaccessibility/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a> for sharing WordPress-specific code examples for accessibility and plans to add resources in the near future. The theme handbook and reviewer&#8217;s handbook will potentially need to be reworked in order to account for the new guidelines. &#8220;The goal is for those documents to explicitly correlate to the theme accessibility guidelines, so that theme authors have specific guidance on what to do to meet those requirements,&#8221; Dolson said at a recent meeting.</p>\n<p>The Accessibility team hopes to announcing new guidelines for theme developers in April 2015, which would then be required as of November 2015. Once the guidelines are finalized for both required and recommended items, the Accessibility team will also need to train the Theme Review Team on reviewing for accessibility.</p>\n<p>For most traditional WordPress sites, the active theme is the face of the website, and accessibility-ready themes undoubtedly improve the experience of WordPress for users with disabilities. However, making accessibility required for themes is a long and difficult path. The possibility of the requirement already has opposition among Theme Review Team administrators.</p>\n<p>When we <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-now-requires-all-themes-to-be-translation-ready\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> about WordPress.org&#8217;s newest requirement for themes to be translation-ready, several readers chimed in on the comments to advocate for accessibility to be required. Justin Tadlock, a TRT admin, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-now-requires-all-themes-to-be-translation-ready#comment-61697\" target=\"_blank\">replied</a>, &#8220;As an admin of TRT, full compliance with our current accessibility guidelines is something I’d fight to not make a requirement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, making a theme accessible can sometimes mean not respecting a designer’s artistic vision. This is particularly an issue with color contrasts. Anything that would hinder design decisions like this is not something I would support. That’s beyond the scope of what TRT’s role is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even with more education for theme authors, additional guidelines pose another hurdle to overcome in the rigorous review process. Tadlock believes it would stifle submissions from new theme authors. &#8220;Requiring accessibility-ready themes would be such a huge barrier to entry for new theme authors that it would be detrimental to the system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Accessibility team is highly motivated to push for this new requirement and is currently working on a precise proposal that will be voted on by the Theme Review Team. &#8220;The important thing with the proposal is clarity,&#8221; Dolson said, recognizing that it could be blocked if the two teams are unable to communicate effectively about the issues at stake. The decisions made in the first part of 2015 will determine the immediate future of theme accessibility in the WordPress.org Themes Directory.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 21:24:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"Post Status: Let’s WordSesh together\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"http://www.poststat.us/?p=7232\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"http://www.poststat.us/lets-wordsesh-together/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1513:\"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7233\" src=\"http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wordsesh-3-752x317.png\" alt=\"wordsesh-3\" width=\"627\" height=\"264\" /></p>\n<p>This weekend, <a href=\"http://wordsesh.org/\">WordSesh</a> 3 will begin.

The highlight of this release is the new centralized site dashboard feature that allows users to manage multiple Jetpack-connected WordPress sites and WordPress.com sites from one location in WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>The new dashboard is mobile friendly and includes the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-2-introduces-centralized-posting-from-wordpress-com\" target=\"_blank\">centralized posting feature that was introduced in Jetpack 3.2</a>. It also allows users to see all of their sites listed together and perform a number of housekeeping actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plugin management:</strong> Turn plugins on or off with one click — per site or in bulk.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiate plugin updates:</strong> Update plugins for a single site or all sites in bulk.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic updates:</strong> Turn on auto-updates for any plugin on a per-site basis or in bulk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jetpack 3.3 is required in order to use the plugin management features, so you&#8217;ll need to update at least one of your sites to check it out. You also need to activate Jetpack&#8217;s JSON API feature and ensure that the &#8220;Allow remote actions&#8221; setting is enabled.</p>\n<p>To view all the plugins you have installed, visit <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/plugins\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com/Plugins</a>.

Centralized dashboard management is critical for scaling maintenance capabilities. It comes as no surprise that WordPress.com is getting its hook into self-hosted sites by moving to support centralized site management via Jetpack.</p>\n<p>In addition to the new centralized dashboard, Jetpack 3.3 also brings many other enhancements to the plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds responsive video support to BuddyPress</li>\n<li>Custom Content Types: Added &#8216;order&#8217; and &#8216;orderby&#8217; options to portfolio shortcode</li>\n<li>Display notice when Jetpack Development Mode is on</li>\n<li>Compatibility with Twenty Fifteen</li>\n<li>Likes: Updated the code to accept arbitrary CPTs</li>\n<li>Related Posts: Allow filter by post_format</li>\n<li>Sharing: add new jetpack_sharing_counts filter for option to turn off sharing counts</li>\n<li>Sharing: Use the Site Logo Theme Tool and the Site Icon as fallbacks for image tags</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 3.3 release also adds several filters that allow developers to further customize Jetpack&#8217;s behavior.

This campaign has resulted in more than 11,000 domains being blacklisted by Google.</p>\n<p>SoakSoak modifies the wp-includes/template-loader.php file in order to inject Javascript, which contains the malware, into every page on compromised sites. You can check to see if your site is affected by using Sucuri&#8217;s free <a href=\"http://sitecheck.sucuri.net/\" target=\"_blank\">SiteCheck scanner</a>.</p>\n<p>After researching the compromised sites, Sucuri found that SoakSoak&#8217;s vehicle of attack is the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/critical-security-vulnerability-found-in-wordpress-slider-revolution-plugin-immediate-update-advised\" target=\"_blank\">critical security vulnerability that was discovered in the Slider Revolution plugin</a> and made public in September. At that time, Envato identified more than <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/1000-wordpress-themes-on-envato-market-potentially-affected-by-revolution-slider-security-vulnerability\" target=\"_blank\">1,000 themes sold through its marketplace that were potentially affected</a> by this particular vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The Slider Revolution issue, though silently patched in February, has been actively exploited since its disclosure. Many WordPress site administrators have not updated their copies of the Slider Revolution plugin to the patched version, leaving their sites open to compromise. Since the plugin is packaged with many themes sold through Themeforest, site owners are not always aware that they are vulnerable.</p>\n<p>According to the report from Sucuri, the SoakSoak attack first scans sites to locate the vulnerable file within the Slider Revolution plugin in order to gain access to the wp-config.php file. If successful, the intruder then attempts to upload a malicious theme to the site, followed by injecting the <a href=\"http://labs.sucuri.net/db/malware/backdoor-phpfilesman02\" target=\"_blank\">Filesman backdoor</a> into the website. The attacker then injects another backdoor in order to modify the swfobject.js file to inject malware that redirects visitors to soaksoak.ru.</p>\n<p>This malware attack is particularly difficult to clean up after. If your site has been compromised, you cannot simply remove the infected files. The backdoors will also need to be addressed, as well as the Slider Revolution vulnerabilities. Sucuri advises stopping malicious attacks through a firewall. If your site or one of your clients&#8217; sites is using the Slider Revolution plugin, it is imperative that you check to see if you are affected and update your site and plugins immediately.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 22:42:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: Pippin Williamson on Building a Community Around Your Open Source Project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=35573\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"http://wptavern.com/pippin-williamson-on-building-a-community-around-your-open-source-project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10938:\"<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pippin-williamson.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35573]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pippin-williamson.jpg?resize=800%2C393\" alt=\"photo credit: inQbation\" class=\"size-full wp-image-35588\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.inqbation.com/photos-of-wordpress-wordcamp-miami-2014/\">inQbation</a>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins\" target=\"_blank\">Pippin Williamson</a> launched <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> in early 2012, he could not have predicted the success that the open source project is experiencing today. The core plugin is approaching half a million downloads and recently passed 100 <a href=\"https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/graphs/contributors\" target=\"_blank\">contributors</a> on GitHub. It provides the foundation for a profitable commercial marketplace of more than 190 extensions authored by the EDD community.</p>\n<h3>The Birth of Easy Digital Downloads</h3>\n<p>As is the case with many entrepreneurs, Williamson discovered one of his best ideas while solving one of his own problems. He had become an avid plugin developer long before EDD was in the picture. &#8220;I wanted a better way to sell WordPress plugins I was creating through my own site,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had been using the Code Canyon marketplace from Envato for a while and had toyed with a few of the other e-commerce plugins, but I wanted something a bit different.&#8221; Williamson had no idea that EDD would soon become his full-time job.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When a project starts out that way, it&#8217;s really hard to guesstimate what the future holds for it. As I continued building on the plugin and making more generalized features that had a wider audience than just my site, it became apparent pretty quickly that others were looking for some of the same things. The project was started in March and by November of the same year, I really started to consider the prospect of it becoming a full-time job for me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Williamson was inspired by Jigoshop&#8217;s and WooCommerce&#8217;s successes with the &#8220;extensions marketplace&#8221; business model. &#8220;As an outsider, it seemed as though the extensions model was working well for them, so I thought, &#8216;Why not?&#8217; It seemed like a good fit. Early on though I had no idea that we would reach more than 150 extensions in so short a time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He built the first couple of extensions for himself, including the Stripe integration. &#8220;Those first extensions were really the ones that proved building a marketplace around EDD wasn&#8217;t an utterly insane idea. Mostly insane but plausible.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Extensibility Has a Direct Correlation to Profitability</h3>\n<p>Easy Digital Downloads is well known for having a codebase that is easy to extend and friendly to developers. Williamson built this into the project out of principle from the early days of EDD, not knowing how vital extensibility would become further down the road.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It definitely started as a core philosophy but became a fundamental requirement as the project grew. EDD wouldn&#8217;t be even half as successful as it is now if it weren&#8217;t for the extensibility,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are still severe pain points in terms of our extensibility, but they are being worked on for future releases. A commitment to always making the plugin more and more extensible is one of the things that has really helped us along the way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Extensibility is the backbone of the EDD marketplace, and it&#8217;s paying off for Williamson and the project as a whole. On an average day, the core EDD plugin sees 400-1000 downloads. &#8220;The revenue of the project has grown consistently since first launching two and a half years ago,&#8221; Williamson said. &#8220;In its first year, we saw steady growth, but nothing amazing by any means. It was enough to tell me there was potential for much, much more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2012, Williamson reports that the project pulled in $25,000 in extension sales, with one fifth of this paid out to third party developers for extension sales. Over the course of 2013, EDD grew its monthly revenue from ~$2,000 per month up to nearly $16,000 per month. Williamson finished that year with ~$190,000 in sales and paid out nearly $64,000 in commissions to third party developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And now, just as we are wrapping up 2014, we have seen more than $456,000 in sales and have generated more than $200,000 in commissions for third party developers,&#8221; Williamson said. &#8220;In 2015 these numbers are expected to grow, just as they have for the last two years. To say we&#8217;re excited for the future would be to put it lightly.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Attracting and Keeping a Community of Contributors</h3>\n<p>Without EDD&#8217;s large community of contributors, the project&#8217;s success would have been severely limited. EDD seems to have an organic way of attracting and keeping contributors. Williamson attributes this to three key aspects of the community surrounding the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We work hard to always try and make new contributors few welcome.</strong> No one should ever be told (even indirectly) to go away when they are trying to give back to a project. By being open to criticism and suggestions from the community, and working to ensure the community feels encouraged to speak up, we have gained a lot of long-time contributors, simply because they didn&#8217;t feel like their suggestions were lost in a dark abyss of nothingness or intentionally ignored. When people feel welcomed, they tend to stick around.</li>\n<li><strong>Every suggestion gets an answer of some kind. Period.</strong> We strive to never leave a support ticket or github issue unanswered. Even if the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;, we still answer it. When people are ignored, they leave, so we never ignore anyone. Period.</li>\n<li><strong>We have actively asked people to help out on the project.</strong> There are tons of people out there ready, willing, and wanting to help; sometimes all it takes is an invitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Williamson doesn&#8217;t think that any of these efforts are unique to EDD, but they have been the most important factors for growing and keeping a large contributor base. He aims to make sure every single contributor gets an answer to their suggestions, no matter how small the contribution or bug report. &#8220;If someone that is brand new to the project feels they have been ignored, how likely are they to ever come back? I think we see this a lot with WordPress core contributors,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are hundreds of tickets on trac that have gone unanswered from new contributors, and I suspect a huge percentage of those people have decided to move on and not contribute since they felt ignored. <strong>It doesn&#8217;t matter if someone is actually ignored; it matters that they feel they were ignored.</strong>&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to maintain a good follow-up process, Williamson has streamlined development of the core plugin through its GitHub repository. New contributors who want to get involved with extension or theme development also have access to a private Trello board where they can connect with other developers.</p>\n<h3>Advice for New Open Source Project Leaders</h3>\n<p>When reflecting on the early days of EDD, Williamson has a few regrets and encourages developers to think about the future when it comes to plugin architecture. &#8220;There is one major architectural change I would make, and that is the use of custom tables for storing data,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We opted out of using custom tables from day one, and that was a mistake. Not properly leveraging custom tables that had the exact database schema that we needed actually made it dramatically more work for us in the long run. We&#8217;ve had to jump through a lot of hoops to build advanced queries for solid store reporting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This mistake has made it difficult to build EDD in a way that will scale the plugin up to a larger user base on larger websites, as needed. Williamson and contributors continue to find ways to deal with it but it is still costing the team a great deal more effort.</p>\n<p>On the community aspect of the project, he has a few simple tips for open source project leaders who want to attract a decent base of contributors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be nice.</li>\n<li>Respond to everyone.</li>\n<li>Make it publicly known that you want contributions.</li>\n<li>Do what you can to make it easy (hint: asking people to email patches is not making it easy.)</li>\n<li>Be very open to criticism.</li>\n<li>Work hard to build an awesome product, as that alone will attract a certain number of interested in contributors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Holding to these principles has made Easy Digital Downloads a resounding success, as well as an inspirational example for WordPress plugin developers. Williamson hopes to expand operations to include a hosted version of the plugin, but doesn&#8217;t yet have a roadmap for how that will play out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would like to see a hosted version be available within the next year or two. We haven&#8217;t officially decided if we will offer one or if we will seek partnering with an agency or other group, but I&#8217;d love to see it come about,&#8221; he said. If he&#8217;s able to launch a hosted version, Williamson will have the opportunity to tap into a whole new demographic of customers, many of whom are likely not developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never run a hosted service before so it will be a whole new experience for me with a whole new set of challenges,&#8221; he said. Williamson counts the strong EDD community as one of his assets in pursuing this new venture:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One advantage that I feel we will have, however, is the rapid development pace that having a strong community of contributors affords us. As we iterate quickly on the self-hosted version, those same changes will be able to be applied to a hosted version. It will also be able to go in reverse: as we test out new features in a hosted version, we can apply those same changes upstream to the self-hosted version.

They also manually investigated each site to determine some of the more complex setups. Factors WP Engine looked for include: if the site was still active, site-wide SSL implementation, and what kind of eCommerce solutions are being used. Here are a few highlights from the infographic.</p>\n<p>WordPress is the most popular platform, followed by Shopify and Magento. One of the most disappointing discoveries is that out of 341 websites, only 39 have SSL support. SSL is important because it provides a level of encryption between you and the server. It also protects customer information which is extremely important if you&#8217;re going to sell things online.</p>\n<p>For over a year, Magento was the eCommerce system of choice, but it&#8217;s now in second place. WooCommerce is now the most popular eCommerce system used by Shark Tank contestants. This makes sense since WordPress is the most popular platform and WooCommere is built to be used with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Check out the rest of the data in the image below and let us know if any of the data surprises you.

For the first six months of 2015, he will be working full-time to push the BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress projects forward.</p>\n<p>Jacoby is essentially pioneering a new way of working as an open source developer funded by the community. There&#8217;s no prescription for how to tackle each project&#8217;s goals, but working remotely in the past has uniquely prepared him for this opportunity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Previous experience working mostly independently and remotely certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt, particularly for things like consistent communication and maintaining momentum,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will be nice to get back into the swing of posting public status updates and more strictly planning out my days and weeks again. I appreciate the freedom I&#8217;ve had since July, but being completely without structure can be risky, too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jacoby anticipates splitting his time equally between BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress. &#8220;In my imagination, fairly evenly in priority order for a few of the long standing issues that have been prohibiting enhancements to WordPress.org, specifically for the Rosetta sites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;GlotPress will require a little more time for me to start being helpful, so I&#8217;ll likely try to focus on the BuddyPress and bbPress queue first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What will a typical day look like for Jacoby when he starts working full-time on the sister projects? He plans to be involved in every aspect, from writing code to mentoring to adding codex contributions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think a typical day will look like a cup of coffee, reading Trac and Slack, providing feedback and mentorship, and shepherding as much activity as I can. That might mean committing patches and doing feature development, increasing unit test coverage and working on the codex, or helping with tools to enable others to contribute easier. There is no shortage of things to do, and I&#8217;ll be looking at ways to multiply my efforts to get the maximum value out of the time I have.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If the development project is successful, other developers may be inspired to create similar campaigns. Jacoby isn&#8217;t the only one with the capability to make a strong impact on these projects. He believes that there are many others who would be able to do that same.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I really hope people look at this campaign as something they can try, too. Stephen Edgar has been absolutely killing it all across .org, so removing that barrier for him is a priority of mine. Mathieu Viet keeps putting out comprehensive BuddyPress concepts that could make their way into core with just a bit more free time and focus. Ryan McCue already volunteers a huge amount of time; imagine if he was 100% focused. </p>\n<p>Matt Gross (currently at 10up) is such a fast learner and can really crank stuff out quickly. Alison Barrett (also currently at 10up) is the same way; crazy fast at learning and implementing new things. I&#8217;d love to work with either of them on the bb&#8217;s again. A few of these individuals may not require outside funding, but it&#8217;s an interesting idea to use it as an option to reduce an employer&#8217;s monetary burden.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Working full-time on open source community projects without distraction, while still paying the bills, is a rare opportunity that Jacoby intends to maximize. If all goes as planned, the first half of 2015 will bring about the removal of the projects&#8217; most pressing hindrances. The success of Jacoby&#8217;s campaign demonstrates that the WordPress community believes in the potential of BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress enough to invest in a trustworthy developer to make dedicated improvements.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 22:01:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"WPTavern: A Newbie’s Guide to bbPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=35431\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"http://wptavern.com/a-newbies-guide-to-bbpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7392:\"<p>If you&#8217;re brand new to <a title=\"http://bbpress.org/\" href=\"http://bbpress.org/\">bbPress</a>, you may not know about some of the ways it can be extended beyond being a simple forum. Additional functionality can be added with plugins, its output can be manipulated through CSS, and development is easy to keep up with. Even though bbPress has a <a title=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/\" href=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/\">getting started</a> guide available, I came up with my own mini guide. Here are some tips to get you started on building a bbPress forum.</p>\n<h2>Where to Find Plugins</h2>\n<p>bbPress is a plugin that was designed to be extended by other plugins. Once installed and configured, simply browse the plugin directory from the backend of WordPress and search for bbPress. There are at least 314 plugins that show up in the search results, not including the ones hosted on Github.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressPlugins.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35431]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35455\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressPlugins.png?resize=1025%2C526\" alt=\"bbPress Plugins in The WordPress Plugin Directory\" /></a>bbPress Plugins in The WordPress Plugin Directory\n<p>Even though bbPress.org has a <a title=\"https://bbpress.org/plugins/\" href=\"https://bbpress.org/plugins/\">section dedicated to plugins</a>, it&#8217;s essentially an alternative to browsing the WordPress plugin directory. Instead of being able to view all of the plugins available, the pages only list bbPress specific plugins.</p>\n<p>Similar to WordPress, bbPress <a title=\"http://codex.bbpress.org/feature-plugins-tracking/\" href=\"http://codex.bbpress.org/feature-plugins-tracking/\">has a list of feature plugins</a> that may one day, be merged into core. The list contains plugins that offer features found in most forum software out of the box, so it&#8217;s a good place to start when adding features. Pay close attention to the <strong>Last Updated:</strong> information as I encountered a lot of plugins that haven&#8217;t been updated in over 2 years.</p>\n<h2>Altering The Look and Feel</h2>\n<p>bbPress comes with built-in theme support where all required elements such as front-end editing are included. If a WordPress theme doesn&#8217;t have support for the various elements that make up bbPress, you&#8217;ll still be able to use it. The built-in support makes it compatible with nearly every WordPress theme. However, I strongly encourage you to use a theme that is bbPress compatible as it almost always looks better than the default.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressCompatibleThemes.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35431]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35467\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressCompatibleThemes.png?resize=1025%2C810\" alt=\"Free bbPress Compatible Themes\" /></a>Free bbPress Compatible Themes\n<p>A <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/search.php?q=bbPress\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/search.php?q=bbPress\">search of the theme directory</a> indicates four pages of free WordPress themes that are explicitly compatible with bbPress. If you&#8217;d simply like to override the default markup to give it a custom look, check out <a title=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/theme-compatibility/\" href=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/theme-compatibility/\">this Codex article</a>.</p>\n<h2>How to Keep up With Development</h2>\n<p>While WordPress releases three major versions a year, bbPress averages two a year. So far in 2014, there have been no major versions released. Compared to WordPress, bbPress development occurs at a slower pace due to a smaller number of people contributing and spending time on the project. Not only does this make it easy to keep up with changes, it increases the opportunity to influence the project.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressDevelopment.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35431]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35469\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressDevelopment.png?resize=946%2C691\" alt=\"bbPress Development\" /></a>bbPress Development\n<p>bbPress uses <a title=\"https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/timeline\" href=\"https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/timeline\">Trac for development</a> where user&#8217;s can submit bug reports and patches. If you use <a title=\"https://slack.com/\" href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, you can join the #bbPress channel where core developers and contributors hang out. This is a great way to get in touch with people and communicate in real-time.</p>\n<h2>Where to Get Support</h2>\n<p>The best way to get support is through the official <a title=\"https://bbpress.org/forums/\" href=\"https://bbpress.org/forums/\">bbPress forum</a>. While not as active as the WordPress support forum, there&#8217;s still a good amount of activity that takes place. It&#8217;s also monitored by all of the core developers.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressSupport.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35431]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35517\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressSupport.png?resize=986%2C575\" alt=\"bbPress Support Forum\" /></a>bbPress Support Forum\n<p>The bbPress support forums follow the same rules and guidelines set forth by the WordPress support forums. There are two documents you should read to familiarize yourself to how it works. <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_Support_Forums\">Using the Support Forum</a> and the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Forum_Welcome\">Forum Welcome message</a>.</p>\n<h2>bbPress Nomenclature</h2>\n<p>bbPress has a set of nomenclature that is different from forum software you may have used in the past. This small guide explains what each term means.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forums</strong> – Are segments of the main forum similar to categories.</li>\n<li><strong>Topics</strong> – Topics are created within forums, they are the issues that are being discussed.</li>\n<li><strong>Replies</strong> – Replies are made to topics, this is the actual discussion.</li>\n<li><strong>Voices</strong> &#8211; Voices represent the number of individuals participating in a conversation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Next Six Months</h2>\n<p>Although development has come to a crawl in recent months, it&#8217;s encouraging that John James Jacoby <a title=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/buddypress-bbpress-glotpress-development\" href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/buddypress-bbpress-glotpress-development\">successfully reached his crowd funding goal</a> as bbPress will likely experience a surge in development and community based contributions over the next six months. Hopefully, the next six months are among the project&#8217;s brightest.</p>\n<h2>Codex Volunteer</h2>\n<p>The documentation and organization of documents on the bbPress.org website leaves a lot to be desired.

As Vagrant development environments are a daily staple of work life at WDS, the team needed a faster way for setting up new WordPress sites with VVV.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bradp/vv\" target=\"_blank\">Variable VVV</a> is their solution, a script that automates the creation and deletion of new WordPress sites using VVV. The script is based on Alison Barrett&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/vvv-site-wizard-automates-the-creation-and-deletion-of-wordpress-development-sites\" target=\"_blank\">VVV Site Wizard</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The original site wizard hasn&#8217;t been updated in about half a year. I&#8217;ve designed this to be a drop-in replacement,&#8221; Parbs told the Tavern. &#8220;All the flags and commands from vvv-site-wizard function 100% the same, so you can just install this and start using it exactly the same.&#8221; Anyone who has used the VVV Site Wizard in the past will be comfortable using Variable VVV right away.</p>\n<p>The new script has a few additional features beyond the original VVV Site Wizard, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to pass vagrant command through to VVV</li>\n<li>An easier way to set your VVV installation path</li>\n<li>The ability to clone a git-repo as wp-content</li>\n<li>The ability to set more installation options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While creating the script, Parbs went through the issues list at the vvv-site-wizard repository and fixed a number of issues. He sees Variable VVV as the spiritual successor to the original tool and has designed it to be a bit easier to use. He noted that it takes just 1/3 the time to type the commands and the command results have also been vastly improved. &#8220;One example is the <code>list</code> command to show you all sites. With vvv-site-wizard, it is a plain list of site names. <code>vv list</code> will show you a colorized output, along with URLs and marking VVV defaults,&#8221; Parbs explained.</p>\n<p>The WebDevStudios team has an extensive roadmap of features for future implementation. Parbs is most excited about the idea of &#8220;blueprints,&#8221; which would offer the ability to install themes and plugins while setting up a new site.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A blueprint would define a list of plugins, themes, mu-plugins, and various site options. When installing, you could grab that blueprint and it would set it all up. I&#8217;m planning on letting you grab from Github, WP.org, a zip file link, etc. I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://github.com/bradp/vv/issues/5\" target=\"_blank\">outlined the idea</a> on GitHub. You&#8217;d setup multiple blueprints, and when you do an install, you could grab a blueprint and use that. For example, an &#8216;ecommerce&#8217; blueprint might install WooCommerce, some other plugins, and _s, or whatever you like.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As the VVV Site Wizard doesn&#8217;t seem to be maintained anymore, Parbs plans to keep Variable VVV going and has also outlined a number of other enhancements in the project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/bradp/vv/issues\" target=\"_blank\">issues queue</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable vv to auto-update itself</li>\n<li>Add deployment capability</li>\n<li>Delete site database during removal</li>\n<li>Add option to add dummy content when creating site</li>\n<li>Allow overriding of /htdocs install location</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parbs plans to add anything that will make developers&#8217; lives easier at WebDevStudios, but he is also open to suggestions. &#8220;I&#8217;ve built the script to be extremely easy to add new functionality, so implementing features people request will be as easy as possible,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The script is now ready for public use. &#8220;Over the past few days, a few people here at WebDevStudios have been beta-testing it, and its really solid,&#8221; Parbs said. <a href=\"https://github.com/bradp/vv\" target=\"_blank\">Variable VVV</a> is now publicly available on GitHub for anyone who wants to use it or contribute back to the project. If you test the script, make sure to leave your feedback and suggestions in the project&#8217;s issues list, as WebDevStudios plans to consistently maintain and extend the tool to make it better.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 19:47:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: Idea Factory: A Frontend Submission and Voting System for WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=35416\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"http://wptavern.com/idea-factory-a-frontend-submission-and-voting-system-for-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4173:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/idea-factory.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35416]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/idea-factory.jpg?resize=631%2C300\" alt=\"idea-factory\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-35420\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the oldest and simplest ways of accessing public opinion is through an up/down voting system. When offered in a controlled setting where everyone has the chance to vote, the system causes the best ideas to float to the top.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/idea-factory/\" target=\"_blank\">Idea Factory</a> is a plugin designed to make it easy for WordPress administrators to set up a voting system where users can submit new ideas from the frontend. The plugin was created by <a href=\"http://nickhaskins.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Haskins</a>, author of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/aesop-story-engine/\" target=\"_blank\">Aesop Story Engine</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Idea Factory was born out of necessity, and the frustration of the lack of plugins that did exactly what I wanted it to do,&#8221;</strong> Haskins wrote in the plugin&#8217;s description. His implementation is simple but built to be extensible, offering developers a number of <a href=\"https://github.com/bearded-avenger/idea-factory/wiki\" target=\"_blank\">filters, hooks, and actions</a>. Idea Factory features the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AJAX powered front-end submission and voting</li>\n<li>Voting is limited to logged-in users</li>\n<li>1 vote allowed per user per idea</li>\n<li>Emails the admin with notification of a new submission</li>\n<li>Extensible with hooks and actions on events</li>\n<li>More ideas loaded with AJAX on front-end</li>\n<li>Mobile friendly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Logged-in users can enter new ideas via a modal submission box. The plugin creates an Idea custom post type and data is stored in post_meta and user_meta tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/idea-submit.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35416]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/idea-submit.png?resize=900%2C783\" alt=\"idea-submit\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-35452\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ideas are displayed at yoursite.com/ideas. Users can only vote once on each idea before they are locked out. Up votes push ideas to the top and down votes send ideas further down the list.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ideas.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35416]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ideas.png?resize=1025%2C537\" alt=\"ideas\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-35432\" /></a></p>\n<p>The design is generic enough to drop nicely into any theme, but you can further customize it by copying the file from the plugin&#8217;s /template-ideas/ directory into your theme. Idea Factory&#8217;s settings also allow you to disable the core CSS file from loading so that you can take full control.</p>\n<p>Each idea and its description can be edited in the admin. If you have a highly active voting board, you may want to turn off email notifications for new submissions. The settings also include an option to hold all new ideas as drafts to be approved before publishing.</p>\n<p>After testing Idea Factory, I was impressed with how easy it was to set up and use. Both idea creation and voting are anonymous, but it might be nice to have an option to display users for each. However, one of the best things about Idea Factory is that it maintains a limited set of features in favor of keeping the plugin lean and extensible.</p>\n<p>An idea voting system can help community managers or developers get a better idea of where to invest their time and how to prioritize new features. It&#8217;s a quick way to take the temperature of your user base, because it allows them to freely express their ideas and participate in voting up the best ones. It&#8217;s also far less time-consuming than conducting a survey.

Theme authors submitting new themes to the official directory must ensure that all text strings are translatable. This also applies to any updates to existing themes.</p>\n<h3>Tips for Making Your Theme Translation-Ready</h3>\n<p>The WordPress Theme Review Handbook doesn&#8217;t yet contain a section with information about preparing themes for translation. However, you can find all the basics on <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/\" target=\"_blank\">how to internationalize a theme</a> in the WordPress Theme Developer Handbook, which is still a work in progress.</p>\n<p>The internationalization section also links to a number of videos and tutorials in its resources section. Many of these will be helpful in walking theme developers through the process of preparing themes for translation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/\" target=\"_blank\">GNU gettext utilities</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJfqgrzjEis\" target=\"_blank\">i18n: Preparing Your WordPress Theme for the World</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/26/samuel-otto-wood-on-internationalization-plugins-and-themes-for-the-whole-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Samuel “Otto” Wood: On Internationalization: Plugins and Themes for the Whole World</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/use-wp_localize_script-it-is-awesome/\" target=\"_blank\">Use wp_localize_script, It Is Awesome</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2009/11/14/ze-fontainhas-i18n-nyc09/\" target=\"_blank\">Zé Fontainhas: Lost in Translation—i18n and WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ottopress.com/2012/internationalization-youre-probably-doing-it-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\">Internationalization: You’re Probably Doing It Wrong</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a WordPress theme isn&#8217;t translatable, then the site it is running on is limited to the theme author&#8217;s language. If you invest your time and hard work into creating a WordPress theme, why not make sure that it&#8217;s able to be used all over the world?</p>\n<p>The new requirement from the Theme Review team is a major milestone in expanding WordPress&#8217; global reach. The official themes directory is often the first place that self-hosted WordPress users look when shopping for themes. The new translation-ready requirement will help ensure that WordPress.org&#8217;s vast library of themes are ready for global use.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 18:34:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: A New User’s Experience Installing and Using bbPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=35320\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"http://wptavern.com/a-new-users-experience-installing-and-using-bbpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8214:\"<p>bbPress is a <a title=\"https://bbpress.org/about/the-story/\" href=\"https://bbpress.org/about/the-story/\">10 year old project</a> that&#8217;s supposed to make it easy to attach a forum to WordPress. On the day after Christmas in 2004, Matt Mullenweg spent an entire weekend coding an alternative to <a title=\"http://minibb.net/\" href=\"http://minibb.net/\">miniBB</a>, from the ground up that at the time, powered the WordPress support forums. bbPress was stand-alone software until 2011, when the <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2-0-stable-now-available\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2-0-stable-now-available\">release of 2.0</a> transformed it into a WordPress plugin,</p>\n<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve kept a close eye on bbPress but I&#8217;ve never used it for a project of my own. Since I&#8217;m only a new user once, I decided to document my experience of configuring and using it for the first time.</p>\n<h2>Activation and Configuration</h2>\n<p>Locating bbPress is easy as it usually shows up as a Featured Plugin on the Add New plugin screen. Once activated, a welcome screen displays information on what&#8217;s new, credits, and a link at the bottom to visit the forum settings.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressActivated.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35320]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35359\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressActivated.png?resize=1025%2C697\" alt=\"bbPress Welcome Screen After Activation\" /></a>bbPress Welcome Screen After Activation\n<p>When visiting the forum settings screen, I&#8217;m presented with a list of options with checkboxes and numbers. While there are not a lot of things to configure, I think a better presentation of the various options would be to split each major section into a tab of its own. Although it was my choice to visit the forum settings from the Welcome screen, I think the Welcome screen is a good place to use Admin Pointers to help new users create a new topic, forum, etc. I don&#8217;t understand why the Welcome screen has a link to forum settings since a new install won&#8217;t have anything to configure.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressOptions.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35320]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35360\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressOptions.png?resize=765%2C888\" alt=\"bbPress Forum Settings Screen\" /></a>bbPress Forum Settings Screen\n<p>While on the forum settings screen, I&#8217;m not sure what it is I&#8217;m supposed to configure in order for the forum to display on the frontend. At this point, I visit the <a title=\"http://codex.bbpress.org/\" href=\"http://codex.bbpress.org/\">Documentation section</a> of bbPress.org and locate a <a title=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started/\" href=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started/\">Getting Started</a> guide. It turns out, the guide is of no use to me or anyone else for that matter.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/GettingStartedToNowhere.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35320]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35361\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/GettingStartedToNowhere.png?resize=986%2C499\" alt=\"Getting Started To Nowhere\" /></a>Getting Started To Nowhere\n<p>The left hand sidebar has a list of related links which point to several different articles on user roles, conditional tags, and functions. It took some effort on my part, but I finally found the article on <a title=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/\" href=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/\">Getting Started with bbPress</a>. This page should be linked to from the <a title=\"http://codex.bbpress.org/\" href=\"http://codex.bbpress.org/\">Documentation main page</a> for the Getting Started link. This simple change will save users time and frustration.</p>\n<h2>Creating Forums</h2>\n<p>Using the Getting Started guide, I created my first forum. Since forums are Custom Post Types, the forum editor looks similar to the Post Editor. It would be nice if hints displayed above each field so users understand which part of the forum they&#8217;re connected to. For example, the title field should have a hint that says &#8220;Name of the forum&#8221; and above the editor, text that says, &#8220;A description of the forum&#8221;. Some of the items on the Forum creation screen make sense but it shouldn&#8217;t be assumed the user knows what each field corresponds to.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CreatingAForumInbbPress.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35320]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35362\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CreatingAForumInbbPress.png?resize=889%2C584\" alt=\"Creating a Forum in bbPress\" /></a>Creating a Forum in bbPress\n<p>There are two different types of forums, <strong>forum</strong> and <strong>category</strong>. Forums contain topics and can be the parent of other forums. Categories can only contain forums and are primarily used as a method of organization. The nomenclature used is enough to make anyone&#8217;s head spin.</p>\n<h2>Creating Topics</h2>\n<p>After creating a forum, I moved on to create a topic. Topics are similar to typical forum posts. Topics are one of the three <a title=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Types\" href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Types\">Custom Post Types </a>created by bbPress, which means the Topic editor uses the same interface you&#8217;d see when writing a post. Similar to creating forums, I&#8217;d like to see the fields labeled for consistency. Creating topics from the backend of WordPress is fairly easy after creating the first forum.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressTopicCreated.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35320]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35365\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressTopicCreated.png?resize=898%2C668\" alt=\"bbPress Topic Created From The Backend of WordPress\" /></a>bbPress Topic Created From The Backend of WordPress\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Frontend of bbPress</h2>\n<p>Everything up to this point has been managed from the backend of WordPress. I&#8217;ve created a category, forum, and topic. It&#8217;s time to see how bbPress works on the frontend. Replying to a topic is straight forward. A form is supplied with quick tag support so visitors can easily style text. After hitting the submit button, the page reloads and the reply is shown. Sometimes, replies don&#8217;t show up immediately because they&#8217;re moderated by Akismet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ReplyingToATopic.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35320]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35368\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ReplyingToATopic.png?resize=684%2C795\" alt=\"Replying to a Topic on The Frontend of bbPress\" /></a>Replying to a Topic on The Frontend of bbPress\n<p>Once I got a handle for how bbPress is structured and what categories, forums, topics, and replies look like, I went back to the Forum Settings page.</p>\n<h2>Not Easy Enough</h2>\n<p>bbPress is a plugin, and because of that, I expect to be able to turn it on and have everything ready to go. As you can see from my experience, it doesn&#8217;t always work out that way, especially when using a theme that doesn&#8217;t support it out of the box. The <a title=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/\" href=\"https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/\">Getting Started</a> guide is important information on understanding how to configure bbPress. Without it, I&#8217;d be lost in the dark.</p>\n<p>My initial experience is rough around the edges and at times frustrating, as I couldn&#8217;t easily find the help I needed. I can only imagine how many others have gone through the same experience.

This was a major turning point for WordPress, as it gave developers a standard way to structure custom content with core-supported features.</p>\n<p>Four years later, custom post types are so commonly used that folks occasionally need a way to switch a post from one type to another. A site admin may want to change how content is structured and presented, and switching content to a new post type can be a huge time saver in some instances.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-switcher/\" target=\"_blank\">Post Type Switcher</a> plugin, authored by <a href=\"http://jaco.by/\" target=\"_blank\">John James Jacoby</a>, was created for exactly this purpose. It&#8217;s one of those plugins that you may not have ever known about until you&#8217;re on the hunt to find a way to convert a post from one type to another.</p>\n<p>The plugin adds a simple post type dropdown to the post editor, which allows you to reassign any post to a new post type.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/post-type-switcher.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35093]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/post-type-switcher.jpg?resize=772%2C250\" alt=\"post-type-switcher\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-35321\" /></a></p>\n<p>The handy thing is that Post Type Switcher can convert nearly every combination of posts, pages, attachments, custom post types, etc:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Page to Post</li>\n<li>Post to Page</li>\n<li>Page to Attachment</li>\n<li>Post to Custom</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What happens when you change a post to a different type? Only the <code>\'post_type\'</code> property of a post is changed. Categories, tags, and custom taxonomies all remain untouched. Featured images remain in place. The post&#8217;s URL will change to whatever the new post type uses. For example, if you change a regular post to a testimonial post type that uses /testimonial/ in the URL, your newly converted post will follow the pattern of its new post type.</p>\n<p>The old post URL should 404 so that you can use a plugin to redirect to the new URL or add some custom rewrite rules to your .htaccess file. While testing the plugin with different post types, I only encountered one instance where a plugin didn&#8217;t properly 404 the original post, but most of the time you won&#8217;t have an issue with this.</p>\n<p>Jacoby has purposely excluded invisible post types, such as revisions, menus, etc., but you can filter <code>\'pts_post_type_filter\'</code> to change how this works if you need access to more post types.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/beatpanda/\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Gerring</a>, a contributor to the plugin, helped to add bulk editing so that you can select all posts in a certain type and convert them to a new type with one quick action.</p>\n<p>Post Type Switcher is very useful if you started out putting content in regular posts but now want to move it into a portfolio plugin or testimonial plugin. Or perhaps you&#8217;ve been running bbPress on your site and want to extract a few of the most active posts to become regular blog posts instead. Another common use might be to convert a bunch of posts to pages in order to create a static reference section for your site. This plugin makes all of that possible.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re planning to use the plugin, make sure to test your post type switches in a development environment first. It&#8217;s also a good idea to backup your live site before making drastic changes to content.

The startup, created by Jonathan Kay, came in second, behind <a href=\"http://wpcurve.com/\" title=\"WP Curve\" target=\"_blank\">WP Curve</a>, in the first round of <a href=\"http://mattreport.com/episode-1-wordpress-startup-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Report&#8217;s WordPress Startup Challenge</a>.</p>\n<p>The new service aims to create the most convenient way to stage a WordPress site, with 1-click copying from production to staging and 1-click to merge the changes back into the live site. WP Stagecoach offers a plugin that hooks your site up to the service with an API key. Staging sites are hosted on WP Stagecoach&#8217;s servers.</p>\n<p>The beta version of the service currently includes the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a staging copy of your live site with one click.</li>\n<li>Copy changes from your staging site back to your live site.</li>\n<li>Choose which changes to import. You can import some or all of your file changes, and/or your database changes.</li>\n<li>Password-protect your staging site.</li>\n<li>Staging site runs on WP Stagecoach&#8217;s server – no need to set up hosting for your staging site.</li>\n<li>Revert file changes if importing from your staging site doesn’t go as expected.</li>\n<li>Staging sites can be accessed via SSL-encryption</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After testing the beta on a simple blog, I found that the build process took several minutes. Once the site is created, you&#8217;ll be given SFTP/FTP login credentials and URL for your staging site. The site that WP Stagecoach creates is instantly public, which has me worried about duplicate content. If you use the service, you&#8217;ll want to log in and install a maintenance plugin to hide the staging site from the public.</p>\n<p>If an import gets interrupted, the plugin can pick up where it left off, which is helpful for larger sites. It also includes an advanced debug mode for tracking down problems.</p>\n<p>All of the staging sites are hosted on a standard LAMP stack, and users will not be able to reproduce their exact hosting environment with the service when it launches. For many people, the stack will be similar enough to their host and will cause no issues. However, if you are running on a more customized hosting environment, WP Stagecoach will likely not be suitable for creating your staging site.</p>\n<p>WP Stagecoach has plans to make it possible for users to create a staging site on their own servers, but this feature will be further down the road. When the team is able to add this, it will make the product a much more versatile tool for WordPress developers.</p>\n<p>At the moment, the service is very promising and offers a highly convenient way to create a staging site for a simple WordPress site on a standard LAMP stack. Those with a more customized server environment will have to look elsewhere for the time being. If the tool adapts to become more flexible, it will be better positioned to reach a larger audience with a wide range of hosting environments.</p>\n<p>WP Stagecoach pricing will be $12/month or $99/year for basic support. The beta is free and the team plans to add a few updates before the official launch.

The Sunrise is a conference where founders of Australia&#8217;s iconic startups describe the early years of their business. The presentation is 15 minutes in length with 30 minutes dedicated to questions.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of great information in the presentation, especially if you&#8217;re running a bootstrapped business. I also admire Ta&#8217;eed&#8217;s delivery as he comes off as a straight shooter. He reminds me of myself when I tried to launch a business several years ago.</p>\n<h2>Presentation Highlights</h2>\n<p>Envato began as a stock Flash template marketplace called Flash Den. Flash Den was eventually renamed to Active Den due to Adobe owning the trademarks associated with Flash.</p>\n<p>Envato started with $30k and is still a bootstrapped company. Ta&#8217;eed receives numerous offers every year from venture capitalists looking to invest in Envato. So far, he has not accepted any outside funding.</p>\n<p><a title=\"http://appstorm.net/\" href=\"http://appstorm.net/\">AppStorm</a> was the precursor to the Apple App Store. Before Ta&#8217;eed could turn AppStorm into an app marketplace, Apple released the App Store crushing his idea.</p>\n<p>At 32:26, Ta&#8217;eed is asked how he came up with the name Envato. He bought it from <a title=\"https://www.brandbucket.com/\" href=\"https://www.brandbucket.com/\">Brandbucket</a> for $1k.</p>\n<p>At 38:50, Ta&#8217;eed is asked to describe how massive the Envato marketplace is. His response, &#8220;We sell something every 6 seconds, we sell a million WordPress theme per year, and we have the largest stock music marketplace by volume with a million tracks licensed each year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At 42:52, Ta&#8217;eed is asked about Envato&#8217;s relationship to WordPress. He admits to the licensing challenges and mentions that, when Envato started selling WordPress themes, he didn&#8217;t know what the GPL was. He describes the relationship as symbiotic.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Dec 2014 02:35:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: Manage Multiple WordPress Sites with WPDASH, Now in Beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=27624\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://wptavern.com/manage-multiple-wordpress-sites-with-wpdash-now-in-beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2721:\"<p><a href=\"http://en.wpdash.io/\" target=\"_blank\">WPDASH</a> is a new service that launched in beta today, created by a group of WordPress developers in Poland.

Those who work in development often have hundreds, if not thousands, of WordPress sites to look after, all of which require regular plugin and theme updates.</p>\n<p>The automatic background updates introduced in <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-7-released-wordpress-now-updates-itself\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 3.7</a> certainly ease the burden of maintenance for many WordPress agencies, but centralized dashboards are becoming critical for successfully managing backups, site uptime, and updates to themes and plugins for multiple installations.</p>\n<p>WPDASH is entering beta with an impressive array of features for managing sites, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add and modify posts and comments</li>\n<li>Install themes and plugins</li>\n<li>One-click updates</li>\n<li>Generate reports</li>\n<li>Create manual and automatic backups</li>\n<li>Monitor server uptime and user browsing habits</li>\n<li>Monitor accessibility of linked pages and inbound link statistics</li>\n<li>Two-factor authentication with Rublon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a look at an example WPDASH overview of activity across all of your WordPress sites:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wp-dash.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[27624]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wp-dash.jpg?resize=720%2C772\" alt=\"wp-dash\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-35166\" /></a></p>\n<p>WPDASH also includes a number of advanced SEO-related features, such as integration with third-party tools for keyword monitoring and analytics services.</p>\n<p>Since the beta period is just now starting, we&#8217;ll be monitoring users&#8217; experiences to see how reliable the service is.

The <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/contact-form/\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Form</a> module is one of its most popular features, as nearly every site requires a way for visitors to get in touch. The module is reliable and easy to use but fairly basic in terms of features.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Jetpack makes it easy for you to extend its features with a plugin. <a href=\"http://www.hughlashbrooke.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Lashbrooke</a>, who has authored more than a dozen plugins hosted on WordPress.org, has just released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-contact-form-auto-reply/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack Contact Form Auto Reply</a> to make it easy for site admins to issue an automatic message in response to a contact form submission.</p>\n<p>The plugin adds a new Auto Reply sub-menu item under the Jetpack menu, with settings for two useful features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Craft a custom reply message using the WordPress WYSIWYG editor</li>\n<li>Set a unique from name and address for auto replies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can even add rich text or images to the custom reply message, which makes it easy to brand your communications for your company or organization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/auto-reply.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35098]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/auto-reply.png?resize=1025%2C401\" alt=\"auto-reply\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-35107\" /></a></p>\n<p>The auto reply message could be something as simple as &#8220;We have received your request and will contact you shortly.&#8221; Or perhaps it&#8217;s a holiday and you want to update the auto reply to notify people of any delays in response time, i.e. &#8220;We will be out of the office until January 3, 2015.&#8221; This plugin provides an easy way to do that in the WordPress admin, without having to set up an auto-responder in your email.</p>\n<p>Lashbrooke originally created the plugin for his own use, because he was receiving numerous messages from people asking for support for his plugins hosted on WordPress.org and WooThemes.com. His custom auto reply message is designed to help point people to the appropriate forum, in case they contacted him for support-related questions.</p>\n<p>After testing the plugin, I can confirm that it works as advertised. The only tricky part is the last setting on the page, which calls for the label of the field in the contact form that contains the email address to use for the auto reply. You have to correctly identify this label or it won&#8217;t send. In my case the label was &#8216;Email,&#8217; which is likely to be a common one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/auto-reply-email-settings.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[35098]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/auto-reply-email-settings.png?resize=1025%2C279\" alt=\"auto-reply-email-settings\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-35108\" /></a></p>\n<p>While an auto reply might seem redundant, since Jetpack already displays a confirmation of the message sending successfully, that extra note in your visitor&#8217;s inbox can be reassuring, especially since it allows them to reply to the email if necessary.

Its popularity is made up of many facets including, the community, themes and plugins. In the realm of open source content management systems, nothing comes close to what WordPress has accomplished. Although it&#8217;s the market leader, its dominance won&#8217;t last forever.</p>\n<p>Mike Johnston of CMS Critic asks, &#8220;<a title=\"http://www.cmscritic.com/what-it-will-take-to-dethrone-wordpress/\" href=\"http://www.cmscritic.com/what-it-will-take-to-dethrone-wordpress/\">What It Will Take to Dethrone WordPress?</a>&#8221; In the article, Johnston explains why WordPress is on top and why Ghost is on the right path to possibly achieving similar success.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve seen some successful upstarts come out of the wood work to try to take a piece of the pie and some are doing quite well in gaining momentum. One particular contender that comes to mind is Ghost.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Ghost is doing well in its own right, <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-doesnt-need-to-fear-ghost-yet\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-doesnt-need-to-fear-ghost-yet\">I don&#8217;t think</a> it will knock on WordPress&#8217; door anytime soon. Johnston lists four things contenders must do in order to dethrone WordPress.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Focus on marketing to developers</li>\n<li>Offer a migration path</li>\n<li>Offer hosted and self hosted options</li>\n<li>Build up a community</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The four steps he lists are a good start, but it&#8217;s going to take a lot more than that to take a chunk out of WordPress&#8217; market share. In 2009, I <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/six-ways-in-which-wordpress-could-die\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/six-ways-in-which-wordpress-could-die\">outlined six ways</a> WordPress could die and named <a title=\"http://www.habariproject.org/en/\" href=\"http://www.habariproject.org/en/\">Habari</a> as a viable competitor. Five years later, WordPress is bigger than ever and no one seems to remember the Habari project.</p>\n<h2>A Combination of Factors</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think any <em>one thing</em> will put WordPress in second place. Instead, a combination of factors would likely need to take place. In no particular order, here are a couple of things that might lead to the project&#8217;s demise.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Project leadership routinely ignores the majority.</li>\n<li>It becomes a large, bloated, legacy project that blocks innovation.</li>\n<li>A competing CMS comes along that does everything WordPress does, except better.</li>\n<li>The community in mass disappears or loses interest in favor of a competing product.</li>\n<li>A huge scandal takes place involving Automattic, the WordPress Foundation and those close to the project.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I doubt any of these things will happen and WordPress will continue to be the market leader for at least the next 10 years.

Roots has appealed mainly to developers, because it incorporates modern build tools into its workflow. The theme  was first released in 2011 and now counts more than 70 contributors to the project.</p>\n<p>Roots currently utilizes HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap, Grunt, and Bower in the starter theme but will will soon be moving to Gulp. The project&#8217;s GitHub repo has a <a href=\"https://github.com/roots/roots/pull/1138\" target=\"_blank\">Gulp branch</a> with the relevant discussion and commits.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Gulp is faster, has nicer configuration files, allows us to easily compile both Less and Sass to the same stylesheet, and more,&#8221;</strong> Roots creator <a href=\"http://benword.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Word</a> said, regarding the upcoming changes.</p>\n<p>This will also include an update to Roots&#8217; asset pipeline, which will allow theme developers to take CSS and JS from WordPress plugins and have it compiled into the single CSS and single JS files that the theme builds. The <a href=\"https://github.com/roots/roots/pull/1215\" target=\"_blank\">new asset pipeline</a> brings changes to project folders, removes differences between dev and production tasks, and adds a JSON-based asset pipeline.</p>\n<h3>Build a Roots-based Theme Using Any Framework</h3>\n<p>Additionally, the starter theme will be moving away from including <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap</a> in order to become framework agnostic. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a Yeoman generator that will allow you to build a Roots based theme however you want,&#8221; Word said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be able to pick from any framework, Bootstrap, Bootstrap Sass, Foundation, and more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Bootstrap still has a very large user base, the Roots community has shown more interest in other frameworks such as <a href=\"http://semantic-ui.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Semantic UI</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">Google&#8217;s Web Starter Kit</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people over the years have expressed that they like Roots, but don’t like Bootstrap,&#8221; Word explained. &#8220;We&#8217;ve even seen some forks pop up (Roots Foundation, for instance) to accommodate other frameworks. By becoming framework agnostic, the starter theme should be able to appeal to a wider audience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Word and his team plan to have the generator ready for the public in the first quarter of 2015 and are currently working to incorporate work from other Yeoman generators.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Roots community introduced <a href=\"http://roots.io/wordpress-stack/\" target=\"_blank\">Bedrock</a>, a modern WordPress stack that uses Composer for managing WordPress along with Capistrano for deployment. Bedrock can be used with any theme. Since its launch, the project has struggled with branding issues. When all the new changes are merged into Roots&#8217; master branch, Word plans to rename the starter theme and keep Roots as the organization name.</p>\n<p>The Roots starter theme has always had a somewhat narrow audience due to the fact that it has a steeper learning curve than other starter themes. Making the change to be platform agnostic should open it up for more theme developers, but it will continue to cater primarily to those who are interested in using build scripts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Roots has been at a point where you can’t use it if you’re not using npm, Bower, and Grunt, and we&#8217;ve completely stopped supporting users who don’t want to adapt to the better workflow we’ve created,&#8221; Word said. &#8220;I struggled in the past with choosing to support the average Joe WordPress developer or to push for WordPress devs to learn tools that make them better at their job. Workflow efficiency is definitely the ultimate goal.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 Dec 2014 18:06:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: nRelate Will Shutdown Its Service December 31st\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=34995\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"http://wptavern.com/nrelate-will-shutdown-its-service-december-31st\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3942:\"<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/QikShutdownFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34995]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19708\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/QikShutdownFeaturedImage.png?resize=639%2C200\" alt=\"Qik Shuts Down Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/slimjim/2772087916/\">slimmer_jimmer</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>The content recommendation service <a title=\"http://nrelate.com\" href=\"http://nrelate.com\">nRelate</a>, <a title=\"http://nrelate.com/content/2014/12/01/farewell/\" href=\"http://nrelate.com/content/2014/12/01/farewell/\">announced</a> it will shut down its service December 31st.

For several years, I used YARPP on WP Tavern to handle related posts and it performed flawlessly. However, at one point, it gave me performance problems because of the resources used on a shared webhosting server. The webhosting provider at the time pointed out that YARPP was taking up too many resources on the server. If you have a limited amount of posts or a beefy server, YARPP is a great alternative because it offers a variety of ways to display related posts.</p>\n<p>After encountering performance problems, I decided to go without related posts. <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-2-9-introduces-multisite-support-and-related-posts-module\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-2-9-introduces-multisite-support-and-related-posts-module\">Jetpack 2.9</a> released in early 2014, contained a new module called <a title=\"http://jetpack.me/support/related-posts/\" href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/related-posts/\">related posts</a>. Unlike YARPP, all of the processing and server resources were used on Automattic&#8217;s servers instead of my own and eliminated my performance issues with related posts. Keep in mind that when you use the Jetpack Related Posts module, the content is mirrored on WordPress.com for indexing and processing.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the module will use the featured image attached to a post in the module. If a featured image is not detected, it uses the first image in the post which may or may not be optimal.

The minimalist, blog-focused theme has so far been well received and users are already eagerly testing it out.</p>\n<p>WordPress developer <a href=\"https://github.com/chrismccoy\" target=\"_blank\">Chris McCoy</a> has created a Twenty Fifteen child theme with a unique twist. At first glance, <a href=\"https://github.com/chrismccoy/fivebeers\" target=\"_blank\">Five Beers</a> appears to be a colorless variation of the default theme, but under the hood you&#8217;ll find a set of powerful AJAX additions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/five-beers.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34677]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/five-beers.jpg?resize=971%2C468\" alt=\"five-beers\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34711\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the most impressive features is the way Five Beers handles media display. It incorporates the <a href=\"http://stripjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Strip.js</a> lightbox to slide images and videos out from the side of the page. You can see a live example of it on the <a href=\"http://fivebeers.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Five Beers demo site</a>.</p>\n<p>The child theme includes all of the customization options of Twenty Fifteen plus several extra features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AJAX Live Search (still working out the bugs)</li>\n<li>AJAX comments</li>\n<li>AJAX archives</li>\n<li>AJAX A-Z Alphabet post loading</li>\n<li>AJAX infinite scrolling with SEO as a factor</li>\n<li>Custom tag page listed by letter</li>\n<li>Lightbox to adapt to galleries and video oEmbeds</li>\n<li>Unlimited widget area creation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, when you publish a YouTube or Vimeo link, the theme will use the cover image (click to play) as the featured image. If no featured image is set, Five Beers will use a default click to play thumbnail.</p>\n<p>Building all of this functionality into the theme is a bit unorthodox, as most theme authors would opt to put these items into separate plugins. I asked McCoy why he opted to do it this way. &#8220;I’m trying to keep all functionality as the theme, because I prefer not to use a plugin if I don’t need to,&#8221; he said. If you use the theme, you could opt to use McCoy&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/chrismccoy/strip\" target=\"_blank\">Strip Lightbox plugin</a> instead and then simply remove the include in the functions file for the lightbox.php file.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s a theme McCoy built for himself one night while having five different brands of beer, hence the unique name. I&#8217;d like to see each piece of functionality pulled out and supported as a separate plugin, but this isn&#8217;t something he intends to do. McCoy originally planned to create it just for himself but will be adding more features next week.</p>\n<p>This child theme is particularly useful if you want to highlight your archived content by including alphabetical sorting and live search, making it easy for users to discover content as they are typing.</p>\n<p>Five Beers currently requires WordPress 4.1 Beta 1+ to use until 4.1 is officially released. The WordPress 4.1 project schedule has the release targeted for the week of December 8. McCoy does not plan to add the theme to WordPress.org, as the <a href=\"http://stripjs.com/license\" target=\"_blank\">Strip.js licensing</a> is not supported in the official directory.  You can download the Five Beers theme for free on <a href=\"https://github.com/chrismccoy/fivebeers\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Dec 2014 22:48:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: How to Find the Number of Feedly Subscribers to Your Blog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=34466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-find-the-number-of-feedly-subscribers-to-your-blog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5050:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34466]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly.jpg?resize=1025%2C443\" alt=\"feedly\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34964\" /></a></p>\n<p>When Google Reader was laid to rest on July 1, 2013, many users flocked to <a href=\"http://feedly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedly</a>, one of the most popular alternatives. Even if you don&#8217;t use Feedly, it&#8217;s likely that many of your blog&#8217;s readers do. Therefore, if you want a true picture of the number of your RSS subscribers, digging into Feedly&#8217;s numbers should be part of your research.</p>\n<h3>Find Your Feedly Subscriber Count on Mobile</h3>\n<p>Feedly&#8217;s UI is notorious for being less than intuitive and <a href=\"http://blog.feedly.com/feedly-tutorial-v1/\" target=\"_blank\">confusing to navigate</a>. If you poke around, you can find a rough number of your subscribers. If you&#8217;re using a mobile device, simply search for your blog (even if you&#8217;re already subscribed), in the top search bar and it will display a rough count.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-mobile.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34466]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-mobile.jpg?resize=402%2C500\" alt=\"feedly-mobile\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-34933\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Find Your Feedly Subscriber Count in the Web App</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for your subscriber count in the web app, click your site in the left sidebar among your subscriptions and then look for your total subscribers under the title.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-web-app.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34466]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-web-app.png?resize=1025%2C762\" alt=\"feedly-web-app\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34942\" /></a></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not too difficult, but what if you want to know the actual count of your Feedly subscribers? After all, there&#8217;s quite a difference between 3,001 and 3,999, especially when you are looking at setting goals. Once you pass 2,000, it seems that Feedly resorts to fuzzy rounding to the nearest thousand instead of reporting actual figures.</p>\n<h3>Feedly Insight Plugin for WordPress</h3>\n<p>WordPress sites can install a plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/feedly-insight/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedly Insight</a> to get an exact subscriber count. It utilizes the <a href=\"http://developer.feedly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedly Cloud API</a> to tap into more exact data about your feed(s). Once you install the plugin, you&#8217;ll notice that it adds its own top level menu where you can click on the &#8220;Feedly Insight&#8221; submenu item. Scroll down to the search bar and enter your URL. It will return a few interesting stats, including languages and an exact subscriber count.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-insight.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34466]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-insight.jpg?resize=828%2C725\" alt=\"feedly-insight\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34953\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can also search your competitors&#8217; URLs in order to see how well they&#8217;re doing at attracting subscribers. After performing your research, you can keep the plugin if you want to keep track of your Feedly stats via its dashboard widget, or you can uninstall it and check back again later.</p>\n<p>Having a full picture of RSS subscribers is important for publishers who want to tailor their content to appear better in feed readers. For example, if you find that you have a large number of Feedly subscribers, you will want to make sure that each post appears with an image. Feedly doesn&#8217;t have the ability to fetch your featured image. Instead, it grabs the first image displayed within your post to show as the thumbnail in its reader. If your post has no images, it will show a blank as the thumbnail, which isn&#8217;t ideal. Adding an image to each post will help you to avoid this.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jmkC6avpJQgdQhuKd2wN0PSYeBzKQ3KQzJEF8F9vZy8/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">claim your own Feedly hashtag</a> using this Google form, which allows you to have more control over what people find when they search for your brand or your #name.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a publisher, you cannot ignore Feedly, even if you&#8217;re not a fan of the product. Feed readers are still going strong and Feedly seems to be leading the pack after Google Reader died. If you have never checked to find out how many people are reading your blog through Feedly, you may be surprised. To get a rough idea, just log into the app. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/feedly-insight/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedly Insight</a> plugin offers a more detailed look and an easier way to monitor your stats.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Dec 2014 21:59:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"Matt: Performance As Design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44539\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"http://ma.tt/2014/12/performance-as-design/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:193:\"<p><a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/performance-as-design/\">Performance As Design</a>, by Brad Frost.

What if WordPress could recommend plugins based on the ones you have installed? Thanks to a <a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337\">recent update</a> to the API, users will be able to access a list of recommended plugins in WordPress 4.1.</p>\n<p>The recommendations take into account the plugins you have installed and suggests plugins based on which ones are commonly used together. It&#8217;s similar to an e-commerce shopping cart that recommends products other customers have purchased based on what&#8217;s in the cart.</p>\n<h2>Recommended Plugins To Get its Own Tab</h2>\n<p>In today&#8217;s WordPress 4.1 developer meeting, the group <a title=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1417641723005178\" href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1417641723005178\">reached a consensus</a> to create a new tab for Recommended plugins instead of replacing the Popular tab. I&#8217;m in favor of this decision because they each have a different definition. Also, the Popular tab shows which plugins are doing well across the directory. Another benefit to keeping the Popular plugins tab is for fresh installs of WordPress, as it gives users a good foundation to start looking for plugins.</p>\n<p>In my tests, I noticed that some of the plugins recommended to me are 5-8 years old. I&#8217;ve reported the behavior to Alex Shiels and it will be addressed before 4.1 ships. If you are testing WordPress 4.1 and come across any oddities with plugin recommendations, please <a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337\">report them</a> in the ticket.</p>\n<p>The Recommended plugins tab exposes new and useful plugins to users instead of limiting them to the Featured and Popular categories. Since recommendations are based on actual data, they should get better as time goes on. Do you think a recommended plugins page is a useful addition to the plugin discovery process? Let us know in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Dec 2014 23:33:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:10:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 02:34:39 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:14:\"content-length\";s:6:\"241221\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 02:30:14 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 250\";s:13:\"accept-ranges\";s:5:\"bytes\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20141029120254\";}',	'no'),

The site you are familiar with has been our mainstay (with a few updates here and there) for the last five years; we’ve grown so much since then and we wanted to launch a new site that reflected not only who we’ve become, but who we plan to be.<br />\n<span id=\"more-10358\"></span></p>\n<p>In 2010, when our last major revamp took place, we had eight people on our staff, and we were still figuring out what our core focus was. We were navigating how to run a successful company and manage employees. We were building much smaller sites with little to no data migrations, and focusing primarily on blogs and small companies. Since then, so much has changed.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-10388\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-08-at-10.19.49-AM-1024x376.png\" alt=\"webdevstudios, WDS, wordpress, web development company, buddypress, maintainn \" width=\"688\" height=\"253\" /></p>\n<p>Now we build very large sites with massive content migrations, work with enterprise level clients, and have a strong focus on custom mobile applications that integrate with WordPress. During this time, we were lucky to have <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/team/lisa-sabin-wilson/\">Lisa Sabin-Wilson</a> become a partner at WDS and <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/team/dre-armeda/\">Dre Armeda</a> join us as the VP of Operations. Our staff went from less than ten to thirty-four strong! We hired Project Managers and now have multiple teams to help run projects. We’ve also designated Developer and Design leads to manage their respective team members and ensure that everything is running smoothly.</p>\n<p>We have learned so much over the last few years, and those lessons have helped us develop our goals for the next few years. We had outgrown what we were before. It was time for us to launch a site that accurately reflects the breadth of our development and design capabilities, our commitment to expanding and demonstrating our expertise, and most importantly, our dedication to our evolution. We are not trying to be the best at everything, but are determined to be the absolute best at what we do (WordPress!).</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/12363871\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"WordPress Fist Pumping at WordCamp Chicago 2010\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Although we have grown tremendously since we first began way back in 2002, the core of our approach has remained fundamentally the same.

While working from home, staying healthy can be a real struggle! Someone who doesn’t work from home might think we have it better than the average cubicle desk job…and well, in some ways, we do!</p>\n<p>We still sit down at a desk, couch, or even bed most of the day in front of our computer. We could work in our pajamas unshowered all day if we wanted to, and even though the vending machine isn’t calling our name, the pantry and refrigerator are wide open, tempting us with endless possibilities of snacking.</p>\n<p>The struggle is <em>real</em>.</p>\n<p>We must take responsibility for staying healthy from our own home throughout the day, and it can be more difficult than you’d expect! Even small changes that we can incorporate into our daily routine can have a positive impact on our health over time.<span id=\"more-10303\"></span></p>\n<p>Here are some easy ways to incorporate healthy habits into your daily work from home routine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Set a schedule. </b>Working from home can lead to unplanned extra hours because technically you never ‘leave’ work. Try setting a schedule similar to what you would do in an office setting: Start time, lunch break, and finish time. Add it to your calendar as a reminder if necessary. It’s really important to maintain a healthy work-life balance and without a schedule you could find yourself working 24/7.</li>\n<li><b>Get up and dressed in the morning. </b>It’s amazing to be able to work in your pajamas all day, but let’s face it: You may not be as productive throughout the day. Shower before you start working (if you can) and put on something other than pajamas. Even work out clothes would do. This will help to get you up and moving!</li>\n<li><b>Take hourly breaks. </b>This doesn’t mean a fifteen minute smoke break, but rather a quick one to five minute stretch. Get up, walk around, stretch, or even do a yoga pose for a few minutes. The downward dog pose is a great way to stretch the back of the body and is very energizing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/upload-1024x689.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10303]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-10307\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/upload-1024x689-1024x689.jpg\" alt=\"upload-1024x689\" width=\"700\" height=\"471\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li> <b>Drink H2O.</b> Not only does it keep you from drinking soda, tea or coffee all day, but is it recommended that you consume eight servings of water a day. I personally think you should aim to drink half of your body weight in ounces. So if you weigh 150 lbs, you should be drinking a minimum of 75 oz a day. Water not only keeps you more energized, but it’s great for your skin too.</li>\n<li><b>Stock the fridge with healthy snacks. </b>If you are the type of person who can avoid snacking throughout the day, we commend you, but for most of us it isn’t that easy! Here’s the good news: If you don’t buy cookies, you don’t have the option to eat them. There’s no vending machine in your kitchen that gets stocked a few times a week with sugary carbs! So if you choose to stock up on apples, grapes, bananas, veggie snacks (carrots, celery, broccoli), Greek yogurt, almonds, etc. then you really ONLY have the option to snack on healthy foods. Pair any of these with a tablespoon of peanut or almond butter and the protein will keep you full longer.</li>\n<li><b>Plan your meals.</b> Another great benefit to working from home is that you are less likely to get dragged into the regular office lunch outings. Eating out at restaurants daily was my downfall when working in an office. When working from home the great thing is that you can cook from your own kitchen. Plan out healthy meals for the week. Eggs, whole grain waffles, salads, grilled chicken with a baked potato…meals that will keep you full and energized should be focused on protein and vegetables.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/picjumbo.com_IMG_0897-1024x682.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10303]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-10309\" src=\"http://3oil7x2swx3d30yjgq23wmyu.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/picjumbo.com_IMG_0897-1024x682-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"picjumbo.com_IMG_0897-1024x682\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\" /></a></p>\n<p>While we get the benefit of lounging in our own private space, having a chat window as the office water cooler, and chilling in our cool footie pajamas if we’re having a bad day, we also owe it to ourselves to not get stuck in a rut. If telecommuting is the future, self-motivation and self-care are the way to ensure that we have long, healthy, happy lives. It is up to each of us to take responsibility for our own health and wellness.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/2015/01/07/stay-healthy-working-home/\">How to Stay Healthy While Working from Home</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://webdevstudios.com\">WebDevStudios.com</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"http://webdevstudios.com/2015/01/07/stay-healthy-working-home/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"WDS Holiday Charity Competition Recap\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/30/wds-holiday-charity-competition-recap/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/30/wds-holiday-charity-competition-recap/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 16:52:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Team\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://webdevstudios.com/?p=8876\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:668:\"<p>WebDevStudios loves to help people, and this holiday season brought on a great new tradition of helping others for the entire team.

Maybe you want to display a list of related content on a single post but you&#8217;re extremely particular about which posts should display as related. Maybe you have a special page template which needs to display various posts as sections or chapters on a single page.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case may be, we always seem to find ourselves needing to attach one type of content to another type of content. With <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/cmb2-attached-posts/\" target=\"_blank\">CMB2 Attached Posts</a>, we give you that ability.<span id=\"more-8752\"></span></p>\n<p>Sure, there are plugins that will do this for you. Here at WebDevStudios we&#8217;ve used <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/\" target=\"_blank\">Posts 2 Posts</a> quite a bit which is a wonderful plugin allowing you to pair content from one post type to another. Why use CMB2, then? Well, why not?? We want to make CMB2 be and do all that it can, and when the need for relationships between post types came up it seemed like the perfect time to integrate this functionality directly into CMB2.</p>\n<p>First things first, you&#8217;ll need to check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/cmb2-attached-posts/\" target=\"_blank\">CMB2 Attached Posts</a> repo. You&#8217;ll drop those files right into your /mu-plugins/ directory, which will register the new CMB2 field type and enqueue the necessary JavaScript and CSS files in the dashboard.</p>\n<p>So now that you&#8217;ve got that taken care of, let&#8217;s go!</p>\n<p>First, we need to add the field like we would with any other CMB2 field:</p>\n\n<p>As an added bonus, our own <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/team/justin-sternberg/\">Justin Sternberg</a> just made an update to this functionality on line 15 above. You can now specify the number of posts you want to pull in when using this field type!</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve got all of your options and parameters set, you&#8217;ll wind up with something like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8757\" src=\"https://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screenshot-2014-11-28-12.04.26.png\" alt=\"Attached Posts\" width=\"957\" height=\"532\" /></p>\n<p>Simple, right?

Unless, I guess, you&#8217;re some kind of masochist. Personal quirks aside, though, everybody can benefit from somebody else taking a looking at their work and providing feedback. It happens informally all of the time; you post some non-working code to Stack Overflow so you can get some help from folks whom you hope will have a better sense of whatever you&#8217;re trying to tackle. Is this code review? Sort of. You&#8217;re asking for help, and while you&#8217;re not specifically asking for feedback, you&#8217;re sure going to get it.</p>\n<p>Before you know it, users will be chiming in with what you&#8217;re doing wrong, what you should be doing instead and (hopefully) why those things are true. The next time you attempt to write some functionality similar to what you had previously posted, you&#8217;ll already have the knowledge to avoid the same problem from happening again.</p>\n<p>Aside from solving a one-off problem, how else can you benefit from peer code review?<span id=\"more-10184\"></span></p>\n<h2>Standardizing Your Code</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-8863\" src=\"https://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/skewed-code-261x300.jpg\" alt=\"skewed-code\" width=\"261\" height=\"300\" />For one, you can standardize your practices. Here at WDS, we strive to standardize our code and processes at every level. We&#8217;re not only following WordPress&#8217; coding standards, but standards for Sass, JavaScript, the whole nine yards! The point is to make sure that if someone else needs to pick up where you left off they&#8217;ll be getting a bit of a head start and won&#8217;t feel so lost when diving in. Hopefully, you&#8217;ve documented your code well enough that a new person can immediately know what you were doing and why. If we&#8217;re using standardized naming conventions then someone new should be able to search, find, and fix or change anything needing adjustments.</p>\n<p>Standardizing your code even helps you in the long run. You won&#8217;t have to second-guess yourself on how to name a variable or a function. You&#8217;ll have it ingrained within you that you always use this type of naming convention for A and this type of naming convention for B. Gone are the days of milling over a function name for six or seven hours. Now you&#8217;re just pounding those puppies out like Mavis Beacon!</p>\n<p>The mere possibility of handing your code off for someone else to work on, however, shouldn&#8217;t be the only reason you strive to write better code. We should always be in the mindset of learning and improving even if we&#8217;re the only ones who will be working on a particular project or feature. So, how do we do that? We ask for help.</p>\n<h2>Getting Help and Advice</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8862\" src=\"https://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-kramlin-300x197.jpg\" alt=\"the-kramlin\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" />Even when we do not need it, we ask for help. If our code works fine and does the exact thing we want it to do, we ask for help. In this case, we&#8217;re not asking for help with a problem &#8211; we just want someone with perhaps more experience to look over our code. To read our code. To judge our code. To scrutinize every bit of our code, and then come back to us with what we did well and what could be tuned up.</p>\n<p>In time, and with enough positive feedback, you&#8217;ll pick up on these little changes, and you&#8217;ll be putting them into action without necessarily needing that aspect of your code reviewed. Now you&#8217;re moving onto something more complex and you need eyes on that, while at the same time someone else is now coming to you for advice on how they can write a piece of code more efficiently. It&#8217;s all cyclical, but not if we don&#8217;t first admit that we are a part of a team and that we can all lean on one another to get better, smarter, faster.</p>\n<p>This works both ways, however. When you present code for someone else to review, they may see something that they never thought of. You could BLOW THEIR MIND. Imagine that? Writing something and asking for feedback, then being told that because of what you wrote, you&#8217;re changing the way someone else will work? The feedbacker has become the feedbackee!</p>\n<h2>The Beauty of Teamwork</h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s the beauty of this whole thing &#8211; this whole &#8220;internet&#8221; and &#8220;working in a team&#8221; and &#8220;trying to get better&#8221; business. Nobody ever stops improving, and if you think you&#8217;ve got no improving left to do, then you&#8217;re probably stagnant and not pushing yourself anymore. Try something you&#8217;re unsure of. Force yourself out of your comfort zone. I&#8217;m uncomfortable for almost all of the hours I&#8217;m awake, and I&#8217;m doing just fine!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with an incredible team here at WDS, who is always open to provide and ask for feedback. It can be a little scary first starting out with a new company or a new team; you don&#8217;t want to ask too many questions because you don&#8217;t want people to think you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. After all, they hired you because you know how to do your job &#8211; how dare you ask questions!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8767\" src=\"https://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sit-and-yearn-300x226.png\" alt=\"sit-and-yearn\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" />Only nobody reacts that way. We want questions. We YEARN for questions. If you&#8217;re asking questions, it&#8217;s because you want to get better at what you&#8217;re doing or because you see something that seems off, and you&#8217;re unsure of why it&#8217;s being done. In either case, you&#8217;re not letting your brain get lazy and bored. You&#8217;re pushing yourself to learn more and to know more and, in the end that&#8217;s what&#8217;s important because that&#8217;s what keeps us all rolling forward.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/18/community-benefits-from-peer-code-review-2/\">Community Benefits from Peer Code Review</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://webdevstudios.com\">WebDevStudios.com</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/18/community-benefits-from-peer-code-review-2/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"Removing PHP4 Compatibility in WordPress Custom Widgets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/16/removing-php4-compatibility-in-wordpress-custom-widgets-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/16/removing-php4-compatibility-in-wordpress-custom-widgets-2/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 20:47:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"contribute\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"object oriented programming\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"php\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"trac\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"widgets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://webdevstudios.com/?p=8750\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:695:\"<p>There I was.

Do I base the <code>@since</code> on when the <code>WP_Widget</code> function was first added (2.8)? Or from when the time it was downgraded to a PHP4 compatibility wrapper for the <code>__construct</code> function (3.2)? I decided to ask the almighty <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/team/ben-lobaugh/\">Ben Lobaugh</a>, my dev lead, to see what he thought. And Ben says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think you should erase the PHP4 constructor as PHP5 is required by WP now and submit it in another patch.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Done! Patch created and ticket submitted. That was easy.</p>\n<p>Later&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Chris]&#8230;are you going to update [your] custom widgets to not use WP_Widget?</p></blockquote>\n<p>WHADDYAMEAN? Surely I&#8217;m not using some old PHP4 compatibility wrapper function!<span id=\"more-8750\"></span></p>\n\n<p>There! Right there, see, I&#8217;m using a <code>__construct</code>! It&#8217;s <em>fine</em>!</p>\n<p>&#8230;Actually&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>And therein lies the problem and the topic of this post.</p>\n<h3>The problem</h3>\n<p>WordPress discontinued support for PHP4 back in 3.2. But, to make a smooth transition and break as few things as possible, some necessary evils were put in the code in the form of compatibility functions. These weren&#8217;t so much to support PHP4, <em>per se</em>, so much as they were put in to support <em>code</em> that was being used that was expecting or based around PHP4 standards.</p>\n<p>There are lots of tutorials and guides that tell you how to build WordPress widgets. And <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22%24this-%3EWP_Widget%22\" target=\"_blank\">many of them</a> are going to tell you to use the <code>$this-&gt;WP_Widget( ... )</code> syntax.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m here to tell you that they are wrong. And this is coming from someone who is right there with you, doing it wrong, too.</p>\n<h3>Why should I care?</h3>\n<p>If it works, why bother? Who cares if the WP_Widget function is just a wrapper for the PHP5 constructor? Let me put it this way: WordPress 3.2 was released in 2011 &#8212; three years ago. PHP4 officially stopped active development in 2008 &#8212; <em>six</em> years ago. By continuing to use what are essentially unnecessary compatibility functions, we&#8217;re making it so that WordPress core is forced to retain pointless functions like this one to prevent breaking other people&#8217;s code that might be using these functions.</p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s not <em>technically</em> <code>__doing_it_wrong()</code> to use the WP_Widget function, it&#8217;s confusing. We already have a <code>WP_Widget</code> in core &#8212; it&#8217;s the class we extend to create a new widget. While it may <em>look</em> like we&#8217;re using a method in that class based on a quick view of that line of code, what&#8217;s actually happening is the opposite.</p>\n<p>I propose that we STOP. DOING. IT. NOW.</p>\n<p>In order to get functions like these ultimately pulled out of core &#8212; or at least moved to deprecated functions &#8212; we need to <em>stop using them</em>. (Sidenote: <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30482\" target=\"_blank\">My ticket</a> for this was closed for compatibility reasons)</p>\n<h3>The solution</h3>\n<p>Instead of using the <code>WP_Widget</code> <em>function</em>, replace <code>$this-&gt;WP_Widget( ... )</code> with <code>parent::__construct( ... )</code>, so that code I showed you above from my custom widget would be rewritten like this:</p>\n\n<p>This is the way <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_API#Example\" target=\"_blank\">the Codex currently suggests creating custom widgets</a>. Not only are we doing exactly the same thing we were doing before, but it&#8217;s much clearer what&#8217;s going on. Even if I don&#8217;t know anything about Object Oriented Programming, and I don&#8217;t know what a construct is, at the very least I&#8217;m not going to get confused by the <code>WP_Widget</code> <em>function</em> (as compared with the <code>WP_Widget</code> <em>class</em>).</p>\n<p>Right now, there&#8217;s no immediate reason to change your code. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t. There are <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30482#comment:2\" target=\"_blank\">reasons</a> why this function isn&#8217;t getting removed from WordPress core anytime soon, but most of those have to do with <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16768#comment:9\" target=\"_blank\">plugin compatibility</a>. It seems silly to still be supporting PHP4 &#8212; in some form or another &#8212; when WordPress officially dropped support for PHP4 eight versions ago (soon to be nine), but this is a solvable problem. If we just <em>fix our plugins and themes</em>, we won&#8217;t need to use old PHP4 compatibility functions, and we can help move WordPress core forward in supporting modern standards.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/16/removing-php4-compatibility-in-wordpress-custom-widgets-2/\">Removing PHP4 Compatibility in WordPress Custom Widgets</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://webdevstudios.com\">WebDevStudios.com</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/16/removing-php4-compatibility-in-wordpress-custom-widgets-2/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WordSesh 3 – 24 Hours of WordPress Presentations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/15/wordsesh-3-24-hours-of-wordpress-presentations/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/12/15/wordsesh-3-24-hours-of-wordpress-presentations/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 19:35:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"dradcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Presentations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"WebDevStudios\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"WordSesh\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://webdevstudios.com/?p=8834\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:712:\"<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again &#8212; WordSesh is back for its third year!

An Admin Theme can be used to create your own color scheme for the WordPress Dashboard or make minor tweaks to the theme that is set in your profile.</p>\n<p>While the overall default admin theme is slick, there might be few items that you would like to adjust. For example: the font size, link color, background colors, etc. Here are some items that you will be adjusting with your plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove box shadow on links and input fields.</li>\n<li>If you like your Dashboard Home to be clear of all screen options, there are still dashed borders showing where the screen options would go. We’re going to remove those.</li>\n<li>Fill in your adjustments: ______________________________</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make these adjustments, we’re going to follow the official guide that is already available in the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Admin_Themes#Creating_an_Admin_Theme_Plugin\">WordPress Codex</a> on how to create an Admin Theme.<span id=\"more-9539\"></span></p>\n<p>To start off, create a new folder for your plugin and name it &#8216;simple-admin-theme&#8217; or whatever name you choose. Open your favorite text editor and create a new file called &#8216;simple-admin-theme.php&#8217;. In this file, you’ll want to paste the following code:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-php\" title=\"admin theme plugin setup\">&lt;?php\n\n/*\nPlugin Name: Simple Admin Theme\nPlugin URI: https://gist.github.com/precode/9ca75a69fe91671b6266\nDescription: A Simple Admin Theme for WordPress\nAuthor: Precode\nVersion: 1.0.0\nAuthor URI: http://precode.io\n*/\n\nfunction sat_enqueue_custom_admin_theme() {\n    wp_enqueue_style( \'sat-enqueue-custom-admin-theme\', plugins_url( \'wp-admin.css\', __FILE__ ) );\n}\nadd_action( \'admin_enqueue_scripts\', \'sat_enqueue_custom_admin_theme\' );</pre>\n<p>The function that you pasted into your file will properly enqueue your stylesheet that we will be using to add our custom styles for the Admin Theme. Save this file into your &#8216;simple-admin-theme&#8217; folder.</p>\n<p>While still in your editor, you’ll want to create a new file and save it as &#8216;wp-admin.css&#8217; into the same folder as your PHP file.</p>\n<p>Assuming you have WordPress installed, you can now add your admin theme plugin to your WordPress installation under &#8216;wp-content/plugins&#8217;. In your WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins and you should now see your newly created plugin.</p>\n<p>Now the fun part begins. Re-open your &#8216;wp-admin.css&#8217; file in your text editor. We’re going to keep this stylesheet simple because you are only making minor tweaks to the default Admin theme.</p>\n<p>The first item we will be adjusting are the links. We will still keep the same color, but we’re removing the box shadow when clicking a link in the WordPress Dashboard.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8796\" src=\"https://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/adminthemelinks.gif\" alt=\"adminthemelinks\" /></p>\n<p>To do this, copy and paste the following and save:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"admin theme css links\">a:focus {\n    -webkit-box-shadow: none;\n    box-shadow: none;\n}</pre>\n<p>After adding the above styles, go back to your WordPress Dashboard and refresh the page. You’ll notice that the box shadow on focus for all links has now been removed. Back in your stylesheet, add the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"admin theme css inputs\">input[type=&quot;text&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;password&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;color&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;date&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;datetime&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;datetime-local&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;email&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;month&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;number&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;password&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;search&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;tel&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;text&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;time&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;url&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;week&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]:focus,\ninput[type=&quot;radio&quot;]:focus,\nselect:focus,\ntextarea:focus {\n    -webkit-box-shadow: none;\n    box-shadow: none;\n}</pre>\n<p>This will update all input fields on focus so no box shadow will appear. Next on our list is to remove all screen options on your Dashboard Homepage. Click the ‘Dashboard’ link in your WordPress admin. Click the Screen Options button at the top right of the page and uncheck all options. We are now going to add the following to your stylesheet to remove the dashed border that indicates where the screen options will appear:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-cs\" title=\"admin theme css remove border\">.metabox-holder .postbox-container .empty-container {\n    border: none;\n}</pre>\n<p>Save your stylesheet and reload the WordPress Dashboard. You’ll see that the dashed borders have been removed.</p>\n<p>From there, you can add your own adjustments by right clicking elements in your browser and click &#8216;Inspect Element&#8217; to get the property name and styles to edit from your browsers’ web inspector.</p>\n<p>You have now created your first Admin Theme; essentially, your first WordPress plugin if you have not developed one before! If you like, you can add your new plugin to your GitHub profile for others to build on and or submit it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/add/\">WordPress plugin repository</a>. When adding any changes to the default WordPress Admin theme that you might think are actual issues, you can submit a ticket to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Trac</a> and provide a patch to fix the possible issue.

If you want to insert the <strong>applicant&#8217;s name</strong>, use the placeholder <strong>[post_title]</strong>. To insert the <strong>link to the application&#8217;s admin page</strong>, use this:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">[blog_url]/wp-admin/post.php?post=[post_ID]&amp;action=edit</pre><p>To insert the job title use <strong>[post_custom_field-_job_applied_for]</strong>.</p>\n<p>Set &#8220;status before&#8221; to &#8220;anything&#8221; and &#8220;status after&#8221; to &#8220;New (wp-job-manager)&#8221;.</p>\n<h3>Send confirmation to applicant</h3>\n<p>If you want to send a confirmation email to the applicant, use the field &#8220;Custom recipient&#8221; and insert the custom field placeholder <strong>[post_custom_field-_candidate_email] </strong>which keeps the applicants email address. Unselect all options for &#8220;Recipient so that only the applicant will receive the message.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wp_job_manager_applications_3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-894 size-full\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wp_job_manager_applications_3.jpg\" alt=\"wp_job_manager_applications_3\" width=\"649\" height=\"325\" /></a></p>\n<p>There is only <strong>one compromise</strong> currently. If you want to update the application, please use PSN&#8217;s &#8220;Block notifications&#8221; feature. Because WP Job Manager unfortunately does not change the post status of a application if you update it and your PSN notification rule would match again on your update. So just mark &#8220;<strong>Block notifications</strong>&#8221; before you update an application (see screenshot):</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_884\" style=\"width: 311px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wp_job_manager_applications_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-884\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wp_job_manager_applications_2.jpg\" alt=\"Block notifications on applications update.\" width=\"301\" height=\"519\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Block notifications on applications update.</p></div>\n<p>This can be handled more efficiently with PSN&#8217;s new &#8220;Limitations&#8221; feature coming with version 1.8.</p>\n<p>I hope this short example helps you with setting up PSN notification rules for WP Job Manager applications. If you need more information about all available placeholders, it is a good idea to setup a &#8220;<a href=\"http://docs.ifeelweb.de/post-status-notifier/rules.html#debug-rule\" target=\"_blank\">debug rule</a>&#8221; only for applications and check PSN&#8217;s log entries.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Post Status Notifier (PSN)\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-plugins/post-status-notifier/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button\">Get Post Status Notifier for WordPress</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2015/881/create-notifications-wp-job-manager-applications/\">Create notifications for WP Job Manager Applications</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de\">ifeelweb.de</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2015/881/create-notifications-wp-job-manager-applications/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"How to find out which WordPress hooks (actions and filters) apply on a page / post\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2015/864/find-wordpress-hooks-actions-filters-apply-page-post/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2015/864/find-wordpress-hooks-actions-filters-apply-page-post/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Jan 2015 23:27:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/?p=864\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:655:\"<p>When I am developing a theme or plugin for WordPress, I often have to deal with the so called hooks, more precisely &#8220;actions&#8221; and &#8220;filters&#8221;.

There are a ton of those hooks in the WordPress core, giving the developer the ability to add custom functionality or output.</p>\n<p>The difficult part with WordPress hooks, at least for me, is to find out the right action or filter for the job I am working on. I can use the official WordPress documentation pages for <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference\" target=\"_blank\">filters</a> and <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference\" target=\"_blank\">actions</a> in the hope of finding a well documented hook which might be the right one for me. But if it is not one of the commonly used hooks (like &#8220;init&#8221; or &#8220;admin_init&#8221;), I often do not know if the hook will even apply on the page or function I am about to customize.</p>\n<p>It even gets more difficult if I try to customize a third party plugin. If it uses hooks at all, you are very lucky if they are documented in a way you can work with.</p>\n<p>So the best option for me is to not rely on the more or less good hook documentation, but to find out for myself <strong>which hooks apply on a page when the user accesses it</strong>. To achieve this I use a combination of Apache environment variables and two small core hacks in my WordPress development installation.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: .htaccess</h3>\n<p>In the <strong>.htaccess</strong> file I add these environment variables:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">SetEnv    LOG_ACTIONS       0\r\nSetEnv    LOG_FILTERS       0\r\nSetEnv    LOG_HOOKS_PATH    [local_path_to_wp]/wp-content/hooks.log</pre><p>As you can see, I create a new writeable file, &#8220;<strong>hooks.log</strong>&#8220;, in wp-content, which will be used as a hooks log file.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Core hacks</h3>\n<p>Then I add two hacks in <strong>wp-includes/plugin.php</strong>. (Note: This is just for development. Don&#8217;t do this on your production site.)</p>\n<p>In the function <strong>apply_filters</strong> I add (the part after the globals):</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">function apply_filters( $tag, $value ) {\r\n    global $wp_filter, $merged_filters, $wp_current_filter;\r\n    \r\n    if (getenv(\'LOG_FILTERS\') == \'1\' &amp;&amp; is_writable(getenv(\'LOG_HOOKS_PATH\'))) {\r\n        $data = __FUNCTION__ . \': \' . $tag . \"\\n\";\r\n        file_put_contents(getenv(\'LOG_HOOKS_PATH\'), $data, FILE_APPEND);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...</pre><p>and in <strong>do_action</strong> I add (the part after the globals):</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">function do_action($tag, $arg = \'\') {\r\n    global $wp_filter, $wp_actions, $merged_filters, $wp_current_filter;\r\n\r\n    if (getenv(\'LOG_ACTIONS\') == \'1\' &amp;&amp; is_writable(getenv(\'LOG_HOOKS_PATH\'))) {\r\n        $data = __FUNCTION__ . \': \' . $tag . \"\\n\";\r\n        file_put_contents(getenv(\'LOG_HOOKS_PATH\'), $data, FILE_APPEND);\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    ...</pre><p></p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Now, whenever I need information about the applied hooks on a page I am working on, I can switch LOG_ACTIONS and / or LOG_FILTERS to 1 in the .htaccess file of my test system, reload the page and check the contents of wp-content/hooks.log which may look like in the example screenshot generated on the login page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wp_hooks_log.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-871\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wp_hooks_log.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress hooks log\" width=\"576\" height=\"605\" /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2015/864/find-wordpress-hooks-actions-filters-apply-page-post/\">How to find out which WordPress hooks (actions and filters) apply on a page / post</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de\">ifeelweb.de</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2015/864/find-wordpress-hooks-actions-filters-apply-page-post/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"Setup email notifications for WP User Frontend submitted posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/810/setup-email-notifications-wp-user-frontend-submitted-posts/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/810/setup-email-notifications-wp-user-frontend-submitted-posts/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Oct 2014 20:25:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/?p=810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:638:\"<p>WP User Frontend is one of the best WordPress plugins for front-end post submission.

It allows you to implement a form where visitors of your website can submit new content, like stories, reviews, events or whatever your website is about. Typically you want the new content to be in pending status after submission, that you or another editor can approve it before it gets published. The free version of WP User Frontend does not support customizable email notifications so you or your colleagues will only receive the default text email. You can use our WordPress plugin <a title=\"Post Status Notifier (PSN)\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-plugins/post-status-notifier/\"><strong>Post Status Notifier</strong></a> (PSN) which <strong>specializes in WordPress Post status notifications</strong> to completely customize the email notifications about post status changes, including new pending posts. It has many features and filters which might come in handy for you when WP User Frontend&#8217;s internal notification system reaches its limits.</p>\n<p>Let me show you an easy example of how easy it is with Post Status Notifier to setup a custom notification rule for posts submitted with WP User Frontend. Of course you can use Post Status Notifier for any other WordPress Custom Post Type, WP User Frontend is just one example.</p>\n<h3>Setting up WP User Frontend</h3>\n<p>First I create a new page and embed the WP User Frontend shortcode for adding the post form.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shortcode.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-811\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shortcode.jpg\" alt=\"WP User Frontend shortcode\" width=\"557\" height=\"262\" /></a></p>\n<p>This results in a front-end form like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/frontend_form.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-813\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/frontend_form.jpg\" alt=\"WP User Frontend form\" width=\"526\" height=\"468\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because I want user submitted posts not to be published directly, I set &#8220;Post Status&#8221; in WP User Frontend&#8217;s settings to &#8220;Pending&#8221;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_user_frontend_setting_1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-816\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_user_frontend_setting_1.jpg\" alt=\"WP User Frontend settings\" width=\"623\" height=\"157\" /></a></p>\n<p>And I disable WP User Frontend&#8217;s internal notifications, which are not customizable in the free version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_user_frontend_setting_2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-817\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp_user_frontend_setting_2.jpg\" alt=\"WP User Frontend settings\" width=\"621\" height=\"152\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Setting up a notification rule</h3>\n<p>Before submitting a post via the front-end form I setup a notification rule in Post Status Notifier (PSN). It should only trigger for new pending posts so I set &#8220;<strong>Status before</strong>&#8221; to &#8220;New&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Status after</strong>&#8221; to &#8220;Pending&#8221;. You can completely customize the notification&#8217;s subject and body text. PSN supports <a href=\"http://docs.ifeelweb.de/post-status-notifier/placeholders.html\" target=\"_blank\">a lot of placeholders</a> which will let you place any information about the new post inside your email notifications. In this example I choose the user role &#8220;<strong>Editor</strong>&#8221; as &#8220;<strong>Recipient</strong>&#8221; . If you have special user roles for content reviewers you can select them here.</p>\n<p>This screenshot shows the rule setup form:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_rule_1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-814\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_rule_1.jpg\" alt=\"PSN notification rule setup for WP User Frontend\" width=\"764\" height=\"1129\" /></a></p>\n<p>After submitting the front-end form, the above shown PSN rule will match and send the email. The Premium version of <strong>PSN will create log entries</strong> to let me know what happened exactly. This allows me to see what emails have been sent and if the texts had been created as expected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_log.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-818\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_log.jpg\" alt=\"PSN Log\" width=\"738\" height=\"315\" /></a></p>\n<p>Additionally the log allows me to check all the available placeholders for a matching rule. I can use this information to adjust my notification rule.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_details.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-819\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_details.jpg\" alt=\"PSN log details\" width=\"666\" height=\"435\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot of the email I received from this example setting:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_email.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-820\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_email.jpg\" alt=\"PSN email\" width=\"692\" height=\"354\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Advanced features</h3>\n<p>But this is just the beginning. You might have editors who only care for special categories. They should only receive notifications about new front-end submitted posts which are assigned to those categories. That is possible with PSN&#8217;s <strong>category filter</strong> feature. Let&#8217;s say you have a user role called &#8220;<strong>Game Editors</strong>&#8220;. You can improve the notification rule above by setting up a dedicated rule only for game category submissions:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_rule_2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-821\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/psn_rule_2.jpg\" alt=\"PSN rule 2\" width=\"740\" height=\"489\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To create nice looking emails you can use PSN&#8217;s <a href=\"http://docs.ifeelweb.de/post-status-notifier/mail_templates.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HTML email</strong></a> template feature. Combined with the powerful <a href=\"http://docs.ifeelweb.de/post-status-notifier/conditional_templates.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>conditional template syntax</strong></a> you can create nearly every kind of notification email you can imagine. Further features are custom <strong>CC</strong>, <strong>BCC</strong>, <strong>FROM</strong>, <strong>Editor filter</strong>, custom <strong>recipients list</strong> and many more. Check out <a href=\"http://docs.ifeelweb.de/post-status-notifier/\" target=\"_blank\">Post Status Notifier&#8217;s detailed documentation</a> to get an idea of all its features.</p>\n<p>I hope this article about using Post Status Notifier with WP User Frontend could help you.

It has very cool features, is extensible and has a very modern user interface supporting AJAX requests for smoothly loading your event data.</p>\n<p>But one thing was missing for our project: <strong>Email notifications</strong>. We needed this because we use the extension &#8220;<strong>Community Events</strong>&#8221; which allows our visitor to <strong>submit their own events</strong>. Each time a user submits a new event we want to receive a mail letting us now there is a new event. It should contain the URL to that event so that we can check it because submitted events get published directly. Another use case would be a notification email about new pending events so that an admin can check them in the backend and publish them.</p>\n<p>Now our plugin <a title=\"Post Status Notifier (PSN)\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-plugins/post-status-notifier/\" target=\"_blank\">Post Status Notifier</a> (PSN) comes into play. With its flexibility you can setup custom notification rules for any WordPress Post Type and therefore including the events of Calendarize.it. This blog post shows you how we setup our notification rules to let us notify about Calendarize.it event status changes.</p>\n<h3>Email notifications for a published event</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the obvious use case. We want to receive a mail each time a new event got published.</p>\n<p>Head over to Post Status Notifier&#8217;s settings pages (Settings / Post Status Notifer) and create a new rule. We call it &#8220;A new event got published&#8221;. This is the internal name and you can name it whatever you like. Next step is to select the <strong>Post Type</strong>. As we want to notify about events we have to choose &#8220;<strong>Events</strong>&#8221; from the drop-down list.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-750\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_1.jpg\" alt=\"Create new notification rule for Calendarize.it events\" width=\"705\" height=\"374\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next we have to setup &#8220;<strong>Status before</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Status after</strong>&#8220;. This is important as it tells the notification rule when to <strong>trigger on a Post status change</strong>. We want the rule to trigger whenever an event post changes its status from anything but published to published, as this is the case when an event gets published. Therefor we select &#8220;<strong>Not published</strong>&#8221; for &#8220;Status before&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Published</strong>&#8221; for &#8220;Status after&#8221;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-751\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_2.jpg\" alt=\"Create new notification rule for Calendarize.it events\" width=\"504\" height=\"105\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to setup the notification text. PSN lets you completely <strong>customize your email subject and body text</strong>, it even supports <strong>HTML mails</strong>. Check the screenshot for the texts we entered. To include information about the event PSN allows you to use <strong>placeholders</strong> like <strong>[post_title]</strong> for the the title of the post. Check the manual to see the list of all <a href=\"http://docs.ifeelweb.de/post-status-notifier/placeholders.html\" target=\"_blank\">supported placeholders</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_32.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-759\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_32.jpg\" alt=\"Create new notification rule for Calendarize.it events\" width=\"767\" height=\"412\" /></a></p>\n<p>The final mandatory part of rule is to <strong>select a recipient</strong>. Post Status Notifier offers you multiple options for choosing the recipient(s), including the blog admin, post author, all built-in and custom user roles, custom recipients list which can be managed inside PSN or just a comma separated list of custom email addresses. In this example we choose &#8220;Blog admin&#8221; and a custom email address. You also may set <strong>CC</strong> and / or <strong>BCC</strong> recipients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-756\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_4.jpg\" alt=\"Create new notification rule for Calendarize.it events\" width=\"781\" height=\"407\" /></a></p>\n<p>To keep this example simple, we skip the other options here, like custom FROM or Editor restriction and click the &#8220;<strong>Add rule</strong>&#8221; button to save this rule.</p>\n<p>Back in the overview page we see our just create notification rule in the list. The check mark in the column &#8220;Active&#8221; shows us that this rule is active.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-757\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_5.jpg\" alt=\"Create new notification rule for Calendarize.it events\" width=\"1021\" height=\"308\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now we can <strong>create an example Calendarize.it event and publish it</strong>. This email would be the result of this example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_6.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-761\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_6.jpg\" alt=\"Create new notification rule for Calendarize.it events\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Email notifications for a pending event</h3>\n<p>With the first rule saved it is now very easy to setup another notification rule for <strong>pending events</strong>. Just copy the first rule and edit the duplicate. Then change the title, subject and body to whatever you like. The important thing is to change is the status transition this rule should match. Set &#8220;Status before&#8221; to &#8220;<strong>Not pending</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;Status after&#8221; to &#8220;<strong>Pending</strong>&#8220;. This is a screenshot of the notification rule setup for <strong>notifying about Calenderize.it pending events</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_7.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-764\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_7.jpg\" alt=\"Create new notification rule for Calendarize.it events\" width=\"750\" height=\"864\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a new Calendarize.it events gets submitted, this example rule would generate an email like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_8.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-765\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/create_new_rule_8.jpg\" alt=\"Create new notification rule for Calendarize.it events\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>These two notification rules are just examples for what you can do with Post Status Notifier. If you need email notifications for other use cases, it&#8217;s about you to adjust the rule settings. You can create <strong>as many rules as you like</strong>. Using the email templates feature you can have nicer looking emails by creating <strong>HTML emails</strong>.</p>\n<p>Post Status Notifier will work with any other WordPress event plugin. <a href=\"http://calendarize.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Calendarize.it by RightHere</a> is just a popular example.</p>\n<p>To check out all the features, visit <a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-plugins/post-status-notifier/\">Post Status Notifier&#8217;s plugin homepage</a>.

Once you have set up everything and your site is online, you&#8217;ll probably want to be informed about new campaigns or payments. This can all be handled by our plugin &#8220;Post Status Notifier&#8221; with which you can easily set up custom notification rules for all kind of Custom Post Types in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Pending Campaigns Notifications</h3>\n<p>Lets start with notifying about new submitted campaigns. Once a user has submitted a new campaign, it will be stored with status &#8220;Pending&#8221; and you or your co-workers will have to review and publish it. We have to set up a notification rule which matches this case. This is straight forward: create a new notification rule, set the Post Type to <strong>&#8220;Campaigns&#8221;</strong>, Status before to <strong>&#8220;New&#8221;</strong> and Status after to <strong>&#8220;Pending Review&#8221;</strong>, done! This rule will match every submitted campaign. You can customize the email texts of course, e.g. embed the placeholder <strong>[post_title]</strong> which represents the campaign&#8217;s title. Use <strong>[post_editlink]</strong> to provide the permalink to the backend editor where the reviewer can directly publish the campaign.</p>\n<p>If you only want to notify campaigns which are attached to certain categories you can use Post Status Notifier&#8217;s <strong>&#8220;Category filter&#8221;</strong>feature. To only send notifications if the submitters is a member of a certain user role, you can benefit of Post Status Notifier&#8217;s feature <strong>&#8220;Editor restriction&#8221;</strong>. To test the new notification rule, set Crowdfunding by Astoundify&#8217;s option &#8220;Test Payment&#8221;, set Post Status Notifier&#8217;s logger option &#8220;<span style=\"color: #444444;\">Create informational log entry when a rule matches a status transition&#8221;</span>  and submit a test campaign. You&#8217;ll get an additional log entry covering all available placeholders you can use to improve your notification emails (see the screenshot below).</p>\n\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/706/notify-payments-crowdfunding-astoundify-post-status-notifier/crowdfunding_astoundify_new_campaign_submit/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/crowdfunding_astoundify_new_campaign_submit-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Crowdfunding by Astoundify notify new campaign\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/706/notify-payments-crowdfunding-astoundify-post-status-notifier/crowdfunding_astoundify_rule_new_campaign/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/crowdfunding_astoundify_rule_new_campaign-150x150.png\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"crowdfunding_astoundify_rule_new_campaign\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/706/notify-payments-crowdfunding-astoundify-post-status-notifier/crowdfunding_astoundify_new_campaign_log/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/crowdfunding_astoundify_new_campaign_log-150x150.png\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"crowdfunding_astoundify_new_campaign_log\" /></a>\n\n<h3 data-wpview-pad=\"1\">Notify about payments</h3>\n<p>When a campaign is online, it would be nice to get notifications about payments. This can be handled by Post Status Notifier too. Create a new notification rule and set the Post Type to &#8220;Payments&#8221;, Status before to <strong>&#8220;<strong>Pending Review</strong>&#8220;</strong> and Status after to <strong>&#8220;Published&#8221;</strong>. The placeholder <strong>[post_title]</strong> keeps the name of the buyer and <strong>[post_custom_field-_edd_payment_total]</strong> the payment total.</p>\n\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/706/notify-payments-crowdfunding-astoundify-post-status-notifier/crowdfunding_astoundify_new_payment/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/crowdfunding_astoundify_new_payment-150x150.png\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"crowdfunding_astoundify_new_payment\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/706/notify-payments-crowdfunding-astoundify-post-status-notifier/crowdfunding_astoundify_new_payment_log/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/crowdfunding_astoundify_new_payment_log-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Crowdfunding by Astoundify notify new payment\" /></a>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I hope that this blog post illustrates how you can use Post Status Notifer&#8217;s flexible rule settings to notify about new contents created by &#8220;Crowdfunding by Astoundify&#8221;. If you have any questions, please let me know.</p>\n<p>Of course Post Status Notifier works with any kind of WordPress Custom Post Type.

You can define custom notification rules for almost any case and with the new version 1.5 you can even layout nice HTML emails in your blog design.</p>\n<h3>Setting up a &#8220;debug notification rule&#8221; to track all Post Status transitions</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_post_type.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-667\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_post_type-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"wp_job_manager_post_type\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>Before we start to configure our notification rules, it is very useful to setup a rule which will match in any job listing status change, I call it a &#8220;<strong>debug rule</strong>&#8220;. This is very easy. Just use the example rule button &#8220;The pedantic admin&#8221; which will fill all the necessary options to match any post status change (It will set status before to &#8220;anything&#8221; and status after to &#8220;anything&#8221;). The only thing you have to change is the Post Type which should be set to &#8220;Job Listings&#8221; of course.</p>\n<p>If you now add or edit a job listing via front end submission form or admin panel you will get log entries and can see exactly what happened. To get all the information about the post you can access from a notification rule, activate the option &#8220;Log rule matches&#8221; in Post Status Notifier&#8217;s options. This will create an extra log entry with a list of all placeholders and their values you can use in notification rules.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-669\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_log_option.jpg\" alt=\"wp_job_manager_log_option\" width=\"748\" height=\"103\" /></p>\n<h3>Creating a confirmation notification for job listing submitters</h3>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s see what happens, if we use WP Job Managers Job Submission feature. First the user has to fill the form and click the button &#8220;Preview job listing&#8221;. If everything is fine, clicking the button &#8220;Submit Listing&#8221; will finally submit the new job listing.</p>\n<p>A look into the &#8220;Log&#8221; section of Post Status Notifier will show some new log entries. The interesting part is to see the post status transitions. The job listing preview mode created a status transition from &#8220;<strong>new</strong>&#8221; to &#8220;<strong>preview</strong>&#8220;, submitting the job listing triggered a transition from &#8220;<strong>preview</strong>&#8221; to &#8220;<strong>pending</strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>With this information we now can create a notification rule to send a confirmation mail to the submitter to let him know that the new job listing has been saved and will be reviewed. For this rule &#8220;<strong>Status before</strong>&#8221; must be set to &#8220;<strong>Not pending</strong>&#8221; (which would include both &#8220;new&#8221; and &#8220;preview&#8221;) and &#8220;<strong>Status after</strong>&#8221; to &#8220;<strong>Pending Review</strong>&#8221; (see the screenshot). The recipient should be the &#8220;<strong>Post author</strong>&#8221; who in this case is the user who created the new job listing (which is a Custom Post Type). The rest is up to you. You can define a custom subject and mail text or, if you want to send a nice HTML mail with your blog&#8217;s design, create a mail template and select it as text to be used.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/666/notify-wp-job-manager-listings-wordpress-plugin-post-status-notifier/wp_job_manager_form/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_form-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Job Submission Form\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/666/notify-wp-job-manager-listings-wordpress-plugin-post-status-notifier/wp_job_manager_form_preview/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_form_preview-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Job Listing preview\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/666/notify-wp-job-manager-listings-wordpress-plugin-post-status-notifier/wp_job_manager_logs/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_logs-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Post Status Notifier log entries\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/666/notify-wp-job-manager-listings-wordpress-plugin-post-status-notifier/wp_job_manager_logs2/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_logs2-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Detailed log entry\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2014/666/notify-wp-job-manager-listings-wordpress-plugin-post-status-notifier/wp_job_manager_confirmation_rule/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_confirmation_rule-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Confirmation rule\" /></a>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Approve job listing and send notification to the submitter</h3>\n<p>Next step is to approve a pending job and check the log entries again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_approve.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-681\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_approve.jpg\" alt=\"wp_job_manager_approve\" width=\"892\" height=\"90\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_logs3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-683\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_logs3.jpg\" alt=\"wp_job_manager_logs3\" width=\"716\" height=\"231\" /></a></p>\n<p>We can see a post status transition from &#8220;<strong>pending</strong>&#8221; to &#8220;<strong>publish</strong>&#8220;. With this information we can easily setup another notification rule to let the user know about his published job listing. The example rule &#8220;The happy author&#8221; already does most of the job for us. Of course we have to set &#8220;<strong>Post type</strong>&#8221; to &#8220;<strong>Job Listings</strong>&#8220;. For &#8220;<strong>Status before</strong>&#8221; we can use Post Status Notifier&#8217;s custom Post Status &#8220;<strong>Not published</strong>&#8221; which matches everything but &#8220;published&#8221;. &#8220;<strong>Status after</strong>&#8221; must be set to &#8220;<strong>Published</strong>&#8221; and recipient to &#8220;Post author&#8221;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_published_rule.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-686 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_published_rule-212x300.jpg\" alt=\"Notification about a published job listing\" width=\"212\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Notification for the admin / job listing reviewer about pending job listings</h3>\n<p>Besides the user notifications, the admin and /or job listing reviewers should be informed about new pending job listings too. The settings for such a rule can be lent from the first rule we created (the user confirmation).  &#8220;<strong>Status before</strong>&#8221; &#8220;<strong>Not pending</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Status after</strong>&#8221; &#8220;<strong>Pending Review</strong>&#8221; are exactly what we need to notify about new pending listings. Therefore we can use Post Status Notifiers copy rule function in the Rules administration screen. Just hover about confirmation rule an click &#8220;Copy&#8221;. Then hover the duplicate entry and click &#8220;Edit&#8221; to adjust the rule to the admin&#8217;s need. Change subject and text to something more appropriate for the reviewer and select the recipient(s) who are in charge of reviewing the job listings. You can choose from a <strong>variety of recipients options</strong> Post Status Notifier offers you. For example you can choose a user role or a custom recipients list (or multiple options).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_rule_reviewer.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-688\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wp_job_manager_rule_reviewer-205x300.jpg\" alt=\"Notification rule about new pending job listing\" width=\"205\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I hope that this blog post illustrates how you can use Post Status Notifer&#8217;s flexible rule settings to create the right WP Job Manager notifications for your use case.

Especially the support for <strong>custom taxonimies</strong> and the new <strong>dynamic placeholders</strong> give us a new, incredible flexibility. To give you an idea of what you can do with PSN besides simple notification e-mails to contributors or admins, we will cover some use cases of our customers on this blog. First we will start with <strong>Buffer</strong> (<a href=\"https://bufferapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://bufferapp.com/</a>). Buffer is a great service which <strong>automatically shares our content to several social platforms</strong> like Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn. Buffer has a schedule feature with which you can decide when your posts will be shared.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_602\" style=\"width: 570px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-602 \" style=\"border: 0px;\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/use_case_buffer.png\" alt=\"use_case_buffer\" width=\"560\" height=\"320\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example workflow: When a WordPress post gets published, PSN submits it to Buffer</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But how can Post Status Notifier help us with Buffer? Buffer has a very cool feature which is called &#8220;<strong>Email to Buffer</strong>&#8220;. Every Buffer account has its own secret e-mail address. This e-mail can be used to send your content to Buffer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_570\" style=\"width: 612px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-570\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buffer-secret-email.jpg\" alt=\"the Buffer secret email feature\" width=\"602\" height=\"479\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Buffer secret email feature</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PSN has a new feature with version 1.4: <strong>custom recipient e-mail address</strong>. We can use our secret Buffer e-mail as custom recipient. The subject of the e-mail should be the text you want to tweet/post to your social profile. If you want to include a link, it should be in the e-mail body.</p>\n<p>With this in mind we can setup PSN notification rules (see the <a href=\"http://docs.ifeelweb.de/post-status-notifier/rules.html\" target=\"_blank\">docs on how to create new rules</a>) which will trigger when we publish a WordPress post. For a first example I will setup a <strong>notification rule for sharing posts with Twitter</strong> with special hash tags in the text.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_573\" style=\"width: 757px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-573\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buffer-psn-twitter1.jpg\" alt=\"Example PSN rule for sharing posts with Twitter via Buffer\" width=\"747\" height=\"942\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example PSN rule for sharing posts with Twitter via Buffer</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This rule will trigger on publishing a post of type &#8220;Posts&#8221; which has not been published yet. For testing I included a Cc email to see what was sent. The rule will submit the subject text to Buffer which includes the static text &#8220;New Post:&#8221; with the automatically filled in post title an the attached categories names. To get a hash tag list of the categories we can use another new feature of PSN 1.4: Placeholder filters. With this piece of <strong>Twig filter code</strong> (see <a href=\"http://docs.ifeelweb.de/post-status-notifier/options.html#placeholders\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>) in PSN&#8217;s options, we transform the comma separated categories list into a hash tag list:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">{% for key in [post_categories]|split(\',\') %}#{{ key|trim }} {% endfor %}</pre><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-572\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buffer-psn-placeholder-filters.jpg\" alt=\"buffer-psn-placeholder-filters\" width=\"830\" height=\"141\" /></p>\n<p>In the notification text we add the placeholder [post_permalink] to include the post URL which will be shortened by Buffer by default. Additionally we include the Buffer advanced command <strong>@service twitter</strong> which will prompt Buffer to only share this text with our Twitter profile. If we do not want Buffer to schedule our tweets, we can add the command <strong>@now</strong> to directly share the text.</p>\n<p>Additionally you could use PSN&#8217;s <strong>category filter</strong> to trigger this only if the post has certain categories attached.</p>\n<p>I have set up this example on my blog www.ichdigital.de and it works great. Publishing post results in a new Buffer entry:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buffer-psn-result-twitter.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-588\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buffer-psn-result-twitter.jpg\" alt=\"buffer-psn-result-twitter\" width=\"783\" height=\"175\" /></a></p>\n<p>As we can see on the screenshot, buffer shows how it received the text: via Email.</p>\n<p>This is just an easy example. If you are using Buffer with several social profiles, it&#8217;s easy to create custom rules for each profile to get the perfect text. Or you just create one rule for all profiles with a text that fits all.

I want to thank all those users who gave us feedback and new ideas for improving PSN.</p>\n<p>One great feature, suggested by Mauro from Argentina, is the <strong>SMTP mode</strong>. It allows you to use a SMTP server to send your mails which is not possible by default with WordPress. Especially when it comes to sending very much emails you will be happy to have the SMTP option.</p>\n<p>Another great new feature is the possibility to select <strong>user roles as recipient</strong> including all custom roles of your WordPress installation. This gives us much more flexibility in customizing the notification rules. This was suggested by Tim from New York.</p>\n\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-plugins/post-status-notifier/05_preview5-2/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/05_preview51-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Options\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/513/the-new-features-of-our-post-status-notifier-plugin-for-wordpress/09_preview9/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/09_preview9-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"User roles\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-plugins/post-status-notifier/03_preview3/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/03_preview3-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Placeholders\" /></a>\n\n<p>Furthermore we got the <strong>Bcc field</strong> to setup bcc emails as recipients and the plugin is fully <strong>WordPess multisite compatible</strong> now. The general compatibility with PHP/MySQL and different WordPress versions has been highly improved since PSN&#8217;s release  and we do not get technical error reports any more.</p>\n<h2>Roadmap</h2>\n<p>But you may be assured &#8211; we will not rest on our laurels as we see more helpful features for PSN. The next new pro feature we will be working on is <strong>HTML emails</strong>. This will allow us to send beautiful notification emails with the site logo, colors etc. to our editors or subsribers.</p>\n<p>We hope you still like to use Post Status Notifier for WordPress. If you have ideas how to improve it, please let us know.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://codecanyon.net/item/post-status-notifier/4809420?ref=ifeelweb\" class=\"woo-sc-button  green large\" ><span class=\"woo-download\">Get it on CodeCanyon</span></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-status-notifier-lite/\" class=\"woo-sc-button  custom large\" style=\"background:blue;border-color:blue\"><span class=\"woo-download\">Get the free version</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/513/the-new-features-of-our-post-status-notifier-plugin-for-wordpress/\">The new features of our Post Status Notifier plugin for WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de\">ifeelweb.de</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/513/the-new-features-of-our-post-status-notifier-plugin-for-wordpress/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WordPress Development Environment with VirtualBox and Vagrant\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/469/wordpress-development-environment-with-virtualbox-and-vagrant/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/469/wordpress-development-environment-with-virtualbox-and-vagrant/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 14 Jul 2013 18:19:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"vagrant\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"virtualbox\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/?p=469\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:647:\"<p>When developing content for WordPress like themes or plugins it is always important to test the results on various server configurations and WordPress versions.

It automates the creation of virtual machines. With the combination of VirtualBox and Vagrant it is very comfortable to work with virtual systems. If one crashes I simpy can start it over. Another great feature is, that I can use my development environment on whatever host machine I work, be it a Mac, Windows or Linux system. VirtualBox and Vagrant are available for those three major operation systems.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-494\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ifwWordPressDevEnvironment-11.gif\" alt=\"Automatically installed WordPress versions\" width=\"552\" height=\"341\" /></p>\n<p>Playing around with Vagrant I stumbled upon the <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants\" target=\"_blank\">Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV)</a> project. It does what I was looking for: building a WordPress development environment with Nginx webserver, PHP 5.4, MySQL 5.5 and some more helpful stuff. It automatically installs the latest stable WordPress version alongside the current beta version. That is great when you develop a WordPress website which will be hosted under the same circumstances. VVV is kind of project focused. For me as a plugin developer it is not completely adequate. I need a server configuration that is found on most webhosters with the minimum requirements for WordPress. This is why I choose to setup my own Vagrant/VirtualBox project inspired by VVV.</p>\n<p>In my project I switched back to <strong>Apache</strong> webserver as it is still the most popular webserver and found on most servers of my customers. Then I need a <strong>variety of WordPress version</strong> to ensure the backwards compatibility of my plugins. I added a routine to automatically install all major versions beginning with <strong>3.1</strong> up to to <strong>3.5.2</strong> at the time of writing (you can easily add other versions to provision/install-wp-dev.sh). Additionally the trunk (beta version) gets installed too. Vagrant is configured to use Ubuntu precise32 (12.04) by default and the default PHP package which is 5.3.10. One open point on my list remains a configuration with PHP 5.2.4 and MySQL 5.0, the official <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress minimum requirements</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-473\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vagrant.gif\" alt=\"vagrant\" width=\"549\" height=\"212\" /></p>\n<p>The cool thing is, that all installions <strong>share the same wp-content</strong> directory (via symlink). So I can put my contents there and can access it from all versions. It is easy to switch betweend the WP version. After the environment is running and the records to the local machine&#8217;s hosts file are written, I can open http://wp.dev/<strong>3.5.2</strong> in my browser. If I want antother version I just have to change the version part of the URL, like http://wp.dev/<strong>3.1</strong> or http://wp.dev/<strong>trunk</strong>.</p>\n<p>Through the possiblity of custom scripts I can configure additional share folders. These are directories on my host machine shared to the virtual environment. My project files reside on my host machine and get shared to the wp-content directory on the virtual server. I can continue my developing work using my favorite PHP IDE with the local project files.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about my WordPress Development Environment, you will find the project on <strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/ifeelweb/ifwWordPressDevEnvironment\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ifeelweb/ifwWordPressDevEnvironment</a> There is also a more detailed explanation on how to setup and configure everything.</p>\n<p>I hope someone finds it as useful as I do.

I always enjoy the four days full of workshops and sessions to keep me up to date with the latest technologies in web technology and PHP in particular. Most of the speakers are well known experts from around the world who love to share their knowledge and expertise with the large number of eager to learn visitors.</p>\n<p>On sunday I joined the workshop &#8220;Test Automation Code Retreat&#8221;. This was about creating acceptence tests for an example web application. In five sessions a 45 minutes and changing pairs (Pair Programming) we developed several scenarios and tried to find the best code for the task. We used PHPUnit in combination with Selenium to run frontend tests. With Behat we learned about the concepts of Behaviour Driven Developement. It was very interestant to learn about how others build their application tests to assure the best code quality.</p>\n<p>The session starting on Monday give a good insight in many different topics. I always like the sessions of Sebastian Bergmann to get first hand information about PHPUnit best practices. Another hot topic was the use of Nginx as an alternative to Apache and the common LAMP stack.</p>\n<p>Other topics on my timetable were &#8220;Git Crash Course&#8221;, &#8220;Automated Deployment: From Jenkins to Production&#8221;, &#8220;Best Practices in Symfony 2&#8243;, &#8220;Appointing a Proxy&#8221;, &#8220;Scaling PHP in the real World!&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Berlin is always worth a visit, especially during PHP conference <img src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/425/international-php-conference-2013-in-berlin/img_1912/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1912-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"PHP conference 2013\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/425/international-php-conference-2013-in-berlin/img_1924/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1924-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"PHP conference 2013\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/425/international-php-conference-2013-in-berlin/img_1926/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1926-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"PHP conference 2013\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/425/international-php-conference-2013-in-berlin/img_1929/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1929-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"PHP conference 2013\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/425/international-php-conference-2013-in-berlin/img_1933/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1933-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"PHP conference 2013\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/425/international-php-conference-2013-in-berlin/img_1934/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1934-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"PHP conference 2013\" /></a>\n<a href=\'http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/425/international-php-conference-2013-in-berlin/img_1999/\'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1999-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"PHP conference 2013\" /></a>\n\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/425/international-php-conference-2013-in-berlin/\">International PHP conference 2013 in Berlin</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ifeelweb.de\">ifeelweb.de</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/2013/425/international-php-conference-2013-in-berlin/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:28:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"hourly\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:8:{s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 01 Apr 2015 07:45:14 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:23:\"text/xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:6:\"server\";s:6:\"Apache\";s:10:\"x-pingback\";s:33:\"http://www.ifeelweb.de/xmlrpc.php\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 18:58:07 GMT\";s:4:\"etag\";s:34:\"\"cddaf5011d9f58168759c34c8a54d58d\"\";s:12:\"x-robots-tag\";s:14:\"noindex,follow\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20141029120254\";}',	'no'),

The notice will be suppressed if a license extension is found.</p>\r<p>The notice can be clicked to be dismissed permanently.</p>\r<h3>Profile Description Editor</h3>\r<p>The code for the profile description editor has been updated.</p>\r<h3>Updated Mailto Button</h3>\r<p>The mailto editor button has been updated to include other options such as &#8220;CC&#8221;, &#8220;BCC&#8221;, &#8220;To&#8221; and &#8220;Subject&#8221;.</p>\r<Img align=\"left\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/87014720/0/wpeditpro\">\r\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;\"><a title=\"Like on Facebook\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/87014720/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Share on Google+\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/87014720/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Pin it!\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/87014720/wpeditpro,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Tweet This\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/87014720/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Subscribe by email\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/87014720/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Subscribe by RSS\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/87014720/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;</div>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/87014720/0/wpeditpro~WP-Edit-Pro-Version/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"\n\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://wpeditpro.com/wp-edit-pro-version-3-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"WP Edit Pro Version 3.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/83385854/0/wpeditpro~WP-Edit-Pro-Version/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/83385854/0/wpeditpro~WP-Edit-Pro-Version/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 17:29:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Uncategorized\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wpeditpro.com/?p=1440\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1644:\"We have some exciting new features in this version of WP Edit Pro: Roles can now be administered using WordPress Roles, or Custom Roles.

In this new version; we have updated much of the plugin.  </p>\r<h3>Buttons Interface</h3>\r<p>The buttons interface is the main area of improvement.  Buttons can now be multi-selected, and moved in groups.  The jQuery used for sorting and dragging was updated as well.. resulting in a much smoother user experience.</p>\r<p><a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~wpeditpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/active_buttons3.png\"><img src=\"http://wpeditpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/active_buttons3.png\" alt=\"active_buttons3\" width=\"408\" height=\"228\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1368\" /></a></p>\r<h3>Custom Editors</h3>\r<p>Another big area of improvement involves creating custom button arrangements for individual users.  When a custom editor is created; a respective user role will also be created.  By using a plugin such as <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/\" title=\"WordPress User Role Editor Plugin\" target=\"_blank\">User Role Editor</a>, these custom editors can be assigned (by role) to individual users.</p>\r<p>More information can be found on the <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~learn.wpeditpro.com/buttons-interface/\" title=\"Knowledge Base Buttons Interface\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge Base</a> article.</p>\r<h3>Disable wpautop</h3>\r<p>The disable wpautop function, after being brought to my attention, was only working halfway.  It would keep the paragraph tags from being added when the page was rendered&#8230; but it did not keep the paragraph tags which were inserted into the &#8220;text&#8221; side of the editor.</p>\r<p>This feature was re-written; which now adds an additional TinyMCE plugin used for retaining paragraph and break tags used in the editor.</p>\r<h3>Moved Options</h3>\r<p>The &#8220;Editor menu bar&#8221; and the &#8220;Editor context menu&#8221; options (previously found on the &#8220;Buttons&#8221; tab) have been moved to the &#8220;Editor&#8221; tab.

This has been fixed.</p>\r<h4>YouTube</h4>\r<p>The YouTube button was sometimes stripping the last character from the code.  This only happened when no other advanced attributes were selected.  This has been fixed.</p>\r<h3>Updates</h3>\r<p>The update to WordPress 4.0 included the updated <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~www.tinymce.com/develop/changelog/?type=tinymce\" title=\"TinyMCE 4.1.4\" target=\"_blank\">TinyMCE version 4.1.4</a>. The TinyMCE update includes better table color selection and other color pickers.  Therefore, the older Color Picker button is now obsolete.</p>\r<p>If the color picker is appearing as a big block in the toolbar, it will be necessary for the user to manually reset their buttons. The reset button can be found to the right of the drag and drop panel.</p>\r<h3>Additions</h3>\r<h4>User Specific</h4>\r<p>An option has been added to the &#8220;User Specific&#8221; tab, which allows the admin to permit all users to access this settings page.  If checked, only the User Specific settings will be available to all user roles.  This will allow each person to set their own unique settings.</p>\r<h4>Nonbreaking Space</h4>\r<p>The &#8220;Nonbreaking Space&#8221; has been added.  It is first necessary to enable the &#8220;Editor Toolbar&#8221;.  Once enabled, click the &#8220;Insert&#8221; tab, and then select &#8220;Nonbreaking Space&#8221;.</p>\r<h3>Removals</h3>\r<ul>\r<li>The &#8220;Color Picker&#8221; button has been removed.  The update to TinyMCE version 4.1.4 includes updated color pickers.</li>\r<li>The &#8220;Editor Scollbar&#8221; option has been removed.  The code was causing issues with the update to WordPress 4.0.</li>\r</ul>\r<h3>Moving Forward</h3>\r<h4>New Buttons</h4>\r<p>One issue currently bothering me is whenever I add a new button or remove an old button to the plugin code.  Currently, whenever this happens, it&#8217;s required for the user to manually reset their buttons before the changes are applied.  I am working on making this an automated process&#8230; which will check the buttons on each page load, requiring no user involvement.</p>\r<h3>Closing</h3>\r<p>This update will ensure everything is working properly between WP Edit Pro, WordPress 4.0 and TinyMCE 4.1.4.  The main changes were with the color picker and the tables.  </p>\r<p>Remember to visit our <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~forum.wpeditpro.com/\" title=\"WP Edit Pro Support Forum\" target=\"_blank\">Plugin Forum</a> to join our community and discussions.</p>\r<Img align=\"left\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/81974111/0/wpeditpro\">\r\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;\"><a title=\"Like on Facebook\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/81974111/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Share on Google+\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/81974111/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Pin it!\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/81974111/wpeditpro,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Tweet This\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/81974111/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Subscribe by email\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/81974111/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Subscribe by RSS\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/81974111/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;</div>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/81974111/0/wpeditpro~WP-Edit-Pro-Version/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"\n\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://wpeditpro.com/wp-edit-pro-version-1-9/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"WP Edit Pro Version 1.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/81974113/0/wpeditpro~WP-Edit-Pro-Version/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/81974113/0/wpeditpro~WP-Edit-Pro-Version/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 16:36:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"WP Edit Pro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wpeditpro.com/?p=1112\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1634:\"Version 1.9 WP Edit Pro version 1.9 was released to the public today.

The associated options have been added to the &#8220;Styles&#8221; tab; under the &#8220;Editor Stylesheet&#8221;.</p>\r<p>This new feature will add two dropdown boxes to the editor.  You may use them to:</p>\r<ul>\r<li>Visually see the activate class and/or id for the selected element.</li>\r<li>Add a class or id; defined in the &#8220;Editor Stylesheet&#8221;.</li>\r</ul>\r<p>The classes an ids are dynamic; meaning they will change as you click around the content editor. </p>\r<p>This is a very easy way to provide newbies with access to better styling; while remaining consistent with your sites styles (by limiting them to what you make available in the stylesheet).</p>\r<h3>License Activation Issue</h3>\r<p>One user brought a very important issue to my attention.  The license activation process uses a form to submit the data.  The form name must be unique, so not to interfere with other aspects of the WordPress environment.</p>\r<p>Our form name was not unique, and if other plugins/themes also used this same form name, then WP Edit Pro would not activate properly.</p>\r<p>This has been resolved; and in this update, we have changed our form name.</p>\r<h4>Potential Issue</h4>\r<p>Because we had to change this form name in BOTH the plugin code AND the code on our activation server; there may be a chance this particular update does not perform successfully.</p>\r<p>The form names MUST match in the code and on our server.</p>\r<p>If you experience any issue with the update process from version 1.7.1 to version 1.8; please <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~wpeditpro.com/contact/\" title=\"Contact\">Contact Us</a> immediately, and we will email you the updated plugin .zip file.</p>\r<p>More info can be found <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~forum.wpeditpro.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&#038;t=302\" title=\"WP Edit Pro Forum\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, on our dedicated support forum.</p>\r<h3>Language Localization</h3>\r<p>WP Edit Pro is now ready for language localizations.  All text strings have been properly configured; and the plugin will have a .pot file in the /langs/ directory.</p>\r<p>If you are interested in providing a translation; we would LOVE to <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~wpeditpro.com/contact/\" title=\"Contact\">hear from you</a>!</p>\r<h3>Plugin Updates</h3>\r<p>Another important issue was brought to our attention when a user realized no other plugin update messages would appear when WP Edit Pro was activated.</p>\r<p>The issue resulted from an error in our code.  This has been fixed; and plugin update messages will show for ALL plugins.</p>\r<p>More info can be found <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~forum.wpeditpro.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&#038;t=301\" title=\"WP Edit Pro Udpates\">here</a>, on our dedicated support forum.</p>\r<h3>Import/Export Options</h3>\r<p>Another important fix is the proper importation of plugin options.</p>\r<p>A very valued user submitted this bug; and noticed an error would display when plugin options were imported.  Most options would still save properly in the database; but the user was presented with an unfriendly error notice.</p>\r<p>We have fixed this issue, and in doing so, found another issue where the user specific options were not imported; also fixed.</p>\r<h3>Other Tweaks</h3>\r<p>Most other tweaks have to do with the &#8220;Styles&#8221; tab.  We fixed an issue where the &#8220;Formats&#8221; dropdown would sometimes overwrite other plugins&#8217; custom styles.  Also fixed issue where backslashes were being saved in the &#8220;Editor Stylesheet&#8221;.</p>\r<h3>Removed Items</h3>\r<p>We have removed the editor options under the &#8220;Editor&#8221; tab (the 10 or so options for altering the editor css).  Any of the previous options can now be written in the &#8220;Editor Stylesheet&#8221;, and accomplish the same exact task.</p>\r<h3>Changelog</h3>\r<p>Please remember to view the <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/wpeditpro/~wpeditpro.com/changelog/\" title=\"Changelog\">Changelog</a> for a complete list of changes.</p>\r<Img align=\"left\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/81974114/0/wpeditpro\">\r\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;\"><a title=\"Like on Facebook\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/81974114/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Share on Google+\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/81974114/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Pin it!\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/81974114/wpeditpro,\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Tweet This\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/81974114/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Subscribe by email\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/81974114/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;<a title=\"Subscribe by RSS\" href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/81974114/wpeditpro\"><img height=\"20\" src=\"http://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png\" style=\"border:0;margin:0;padding:0;\"></a>&#160;</div>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/81974114/0/wpeditpro~WP-Edit-Pro-Version/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:26:\"http://wpeditpro.com/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"hourly\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:8:{s:13:\"cache-control\";s:12:\"max-age=1800\";s:14:\"content-length\";s:5:\"65772\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:23:\"text/xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:4:\"etag\";s:34:\"\"f572b501746808cf0d1f53072f35f18e\"\";s:6:\"server\";s:17:\"Microsoft-IIS/7.5\";s:12:\"x-powered-by\";s:7:\"ASP.NET\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 06 Apr 2015 03:58:01 GMT\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20141029120254\";}',	'no'),

WPML 3.1.9.4 addresses this change and allows you to develop against the upcoming WordPress 4.2 release.</strong></p>\n<p>Surprises are great when you have a birthday but not when software updates (automatically). April is going to be a busy month for many people with Easter and Hanukkah holidays. So, we&#8217;ve decided to push forward this update for WordPress 4.2, so that you have one surprise less to deal with over the busy holiday season.</p>\n<p>If you are working on new client sites, we recommend that you switch to WordPress 4.2 and to this new version of WPML. For production sites, you can safely update to WPML 3.1.9.4. It runs fine on older WordPress versions and will be fine on WordPress 4.2 when it&#8217;s released.</p>\n<div style=\"margin:1em; padding:1em 2em; background-color:#F0FFF0; border:1pt solid #80F080;\">\n<h3>Update to WPML 3.1.9.4 (or later) before switching to WordPress 4.2</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.2 is not yet ready for production sites. However, please take note that before you update to it (once WP 4.2 is officially released), you need to update WPML.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.2 made a significant change in taxonomy handling. Older versions of WPML will not work with WordPress 4.2 correctly.</p>\n<p>We recommend that you update WPML now and not have to worry about it later.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Bug Fixes in WPML 3.1.9.4</h2>\n<p>This version, besides including the changes for WordPress 4.2, includes a number of fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed languages order settings retention</li>\n<li>Fixed &#8220;Catchable fatal error: Object of class stdClass could not be converted to string&#8221; when visiting the plugins page or scanning the wpml-config.xml file.</li>\n<li>Fixed &#8220;Duplicate featured image to translation&#8221; checkbox not getting automatically checked</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overall Improvements</h2>\n<p>This version improves the performance when duplicating posts and synchronizing terms at the same time. It also comes with an updated version of WPML&#8217;s Installer, which is faster and includes important changes for WordPress 4.2 compatibility.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.2 Taxonomy Changes</h2>\n<p>Prior to WordPress version 4.2 it was possible to share a term between multiple taxonomies. This meant that you could for example have a term named &#8220;index&#8221;, that was a category as well as a post_tag.</p>\n<p>WordPress handled this terms splitting by assigning each term a term_id and a term_taxonomy_id. The term_id was the same for each term across all taxonomies, while the term_taxonomy_id was a unique number associated with a specific term and taxonomy.</p>\n<p>Hence, if the term &#8220;index&#8221; was associated with the term_id &#8220;3&#8221;, it would also be associated with two term_taxonomy_ids for its taxonomies &#8220;category&#8221; and &#8220;tag&#8221;.</p>\n<p>WPML allows setting specific taxonomies to be either translatable or not, so we used the term_taxonomy_id to identify terms and and not the term_ids. This meant that WPML had to internally synchronize all the term_taxonomy_ids associated with a specific term_id, in case a user made changes to a term that was shared between taxonomies.</p>\n<p>WordPress team came up with a roadmap to untangle this complication. WordPress 4.1.1 stopped creating shared terms. WordPress 4.2 cleans up the database and splits shared terms. Instead of having one term shared for multiple taxonomy, you will now have different terms, one for each taxonomy. Fortunately, WordPress 4.2 also provides an API that allows plugins (like WPML) to know which terms have been split (hurray!).</p>\n<p>WPML responds to this change by adding migration logic which would update term translation. We check which terms have split and automatically duplicate translations for them. The idea is that you don&#8217;t need to do any editing on your site when terms are split in the database. You can just update to WordPress 4.2 and things take care of themselves.</p>\n<p>Please note that plugins and themes that use taxonomy are effected by WordPress 4.2. We think that this is a very welcome change. It simplifies the logic for handling taxonomy and makes future development easier. However, we recommend that you check the compatibility status of your theme and other plugins before you update to WordPress 4.2. Pay special attention to themes and plugins that make heavy use of taxonomy, as they might need updates.</p>\n<h2>WPML 3.2 Status</h2>\n<p>WPML team is back to version 3.2, with all the new features it promises. We wanted to push this update for WordPress 4.2 before Easter, so we pushed out this version. After Easter we are planning to release the first release candidate for WPML 3.2.</p>\n<h2>Want to Review WPML Translations?</h2>\n<p>We are completing a big update for translations for WPML to 16 languages. This update includes WPML and all its components. We want translation to be complete and sensible.</p>\n<p>WPML team includes people from different countries in the world, so we are already reviewing translations to most languages. However, we are looking for help reviewing translations to <strong>Japanese</strong>, <strong>Korean</strong>, and <strong>Swedish</strong>.</p>\n<p>Of course, we can get these languages reviewed by independent translators, but it&#8217;s not the same as a real developer who speaks that language. If you speak Japanese, Korean or Swedish and can spare an hour, please leave your comment here. We&#8217;ll create an online test site for you and would love to receive your translation feedback.</p>\n<h2>How to Download</h2>\n<p>If you registered WPML on your site, you will receive this update automatically to all your sites. Log in to your admin dashboard and click on Plugins. You should see the update there. Please be sure to update all WPML components.</p>\n<h2>Feedback?</h2>\n<p>We hope that this early update of WPML for WordPress 4.2 will help you with the upcoming WordPress 4.2 release. If you have any questions, ideas or suggestions, leave your comments and we&#8217;ll get back to you.</p>\n<p>Please remember that WordPress 4.2 is still in development.

Fortunately, our update came before these exploits became public and most webmasters have succeeded updated WPML on their sites. This update is available for clients with valid accounts. We&#8217;ve noticed that there is a group of expired accounts which is running older versions of WPML, which need to be secured too. This week, we are running a special discount, which allows people with expired accounts to upgrade and receive these updates &#8216;at cost&#8217;.</strong></p>\n<p>Updating from very old versions of plugins can be a pain. We know and appreciate this. However, we&#8217;re certain that getting hacked can cause an even bigger headache. We are offering everyone who previously bought from us and has an expired account, to upgrade their accounts and receive security updates, at a 50% discount. Normally we don&#8217;t run sales, promotions, black Friday deals, etc. We believe in one fair price for everyone, always. However, in this special situation, we want to make sure that everyone who ever bought from us has an affordable access to security updates.</p>\n<p>To facilitate this major upgrade, the entire WPML team will be on support work. This includes our support team, developers and theme compatibility. We&#8217;ll hold off with planned development for a few days, to make sure that every client who needs assistance with this update receives it in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;re not too happy to be in the center of this &#8216;panic mode&#8217;, but this is life. You do your very best always, but sometimes there are glitches. Our responsibility to our clients and to the entire WordPress ecosystem is to respond to security issues immediately and make sure that clients are always protected.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re sending email reminders to all clients with expired accounts. These emails include exact instructions on how to upgrade with the discount and get their sites updated. Please, be sure to create full backup of your sites before any updates. Also, remember to update not only WPML but WordPress, your theme and any plugins that are outdated.</p>\n<h2>Who can upgrade with this offer?</h2>\n<p>Anyone with an old and expired account, either <strong>Multilingual Blog</strong> or <strong>Multilingual CMS</strong>, can take this offer. All upgrades are to the <strong>Multilingual CMS Lifetime</strong> option.</p>\n<h2>How long will this offer be available?</h2>\n<p>The special discount <del>will expire on April 20th 2015</del> has now expired. We offer free security upgrades to everyone, so you don&#8217;t need to pay anything to get it. We urge you not to wait for the last day for this. We&#8217;ve created this offer as a response to a security update and we want to see all WPML sites updated as soon as possible. Waiting for the last minute is not recommended. Get the update today and protect your sites ASAP.</p>\n<h2>How to take up this upgrade offer?</h2>\n<p>To take advantage of this special discount, if you have an expired WPML account, first, <a href=\"https://wpml.org/account/\">log in</a>. Then, our system will detect that you have an old expired account and will offer you an upgrade at 50% cost. This is only available from within your WPML account.</p>\n<p>Once you upgrade to a Lifetime account, you will be able to download new versions with the recent security fixes. When you update WPML, be sure to update all WPML components that you use. If you are running older sites, we strongly recommend to make sure that everything is updated. This should include WordPress, your theme and all plugins (including WPML). Remember that almost everything you use received security updates recently.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve listed detailed instructions for first-time installs, manual updates and automated updates in <a href=\"http://wpml.org/faq/install-wpml/\">WPML installation</a> FAQ page.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, concerns and other ideas, leave your comments and we&#8217;ll get back to you.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wpml?a=7-aXEYjWC0E:Ah3mTvr4VUU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wpml?i=7-aXEYjWC0E:Ah3mTvr4VUU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wpml?a=7-aXEYjWC0E:Ah3mTvr4VUU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wpml?i=7-aXEYjWC0E:Ah3mTvr4VUU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wpml?a=7-aXEYjWC0E:Ah3mTvr4VUU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wpml?i=7-aXEYjWC0E:Ah3mTvr4VUU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wpml/~4/7-aXEYjWC0E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wpml.org/2015/03/special-discount-for-expired-wpml-accounts-to-access-security-updates/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2:\"50\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wpml.org/2015/03/special-discount-for-expired-wpml-accounts-to-access-security-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"This week compatible – Neighborhood, Quins, WP Ultimate Recipe, Slash Admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wpml/~3/MkB_g0dzGeQ/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wpml.org/2015/03/this-week-compatible-neighborhood-quins-wp-ultimate-recipe-slash-admin/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 06:00:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"Compatibility Bulletin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"http://wpml.org/?p=582609\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:314:\"Today we are happy to announce that we have 2 themes and 2 plugins to add to our compatibility list.

We’ve brought these experiences from your admin and re-created them right here on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Theme Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">Theme Directory</a> has a better browsing experience, with handy tabs where you can view featured, popular, and the latest themes. As with the theme experience in your admin, you can use the feature filter to browse for just the right theme for your WordPress website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3572\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-1024x768.png\" alt=\"theme-directory\" width=\"692\" height=\"519\" /></p>\n<p>Click on a theme to get more information about it, including shiny screenshots, ratings, and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3573\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-individual-1024x768.png\" alt=\"theme-directory-individual\" width=\"692\" height=\"519\" /></p>\n<p>Konstantin Obenland <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/10/new-theme-directory/\">posted a good overview</a> of everything involved with the theme directory overhaul and followed up with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/31/theme-directory-stats/\">a post on improved statistics</a>.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">Plugin Directory</a> has a brand new theme that mirrors the experience in your WordPress admin, with a more visual experience, and better search and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3594\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/plugin-directory-1024x768.png\" alt=\"plugin-directory\" width=\"692\" height=\"519\" /></p>\n<p>As well as a facelift, there are some great new features for you to play around with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Favorites – when you’re logged in to you WordPress.org account, this page gives you direct access to the plugins that you have favorited.</li>\n<li>Beta Testing – try out plugins where developers are experimenting with new features for WordPress.</li>\n<li>Search by plugin author – you can search for a plugin author using their username.</li>\n<li>Better statistics – listings now display the number of active installs so you can see how many people are actually using a plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/04/new-plugin-directory-theme/\">overview of the new theme</a> was posted by Scott Reilly.</p>\n<h2>Better Statistics</h2>\n<p>We’ve made huge improvements to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">our statistics</a>. This gives us more useful information about the WordPress versions people are using, their PHP version, and their MySQL version.</p>\n<p>Already these new statistics have provided us with useful insights into WordPress usage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More than 43% of all sites are running the latest version of WordPress. Previously, we thought only 10% of sites were up-to-date. By excluding sites that are no longer online we were able to improve these statistics.</li>\n<li>We were able to clear up the data around WordPress 3.0, bringing it more in line with expectations. This anomaly was a by-product of spammers.</li>\n<li>Only 15.9% of sites are using PHP 5.2, which is better than we thought.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the coming months we’ll be able to use these statistics to bring you new tools and improvements, and to make more informed decisions across the board.

It was added to WordPress in version 2.6 and can be found in the Tools menu.</p>\n<p>One of the major features coming in WordPress 4.2 is a completely revamped PressThis bookmarklet. Michael Arestad <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/18/press-this-revamp-merge-proposal/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/18/press-this-revamp-merge-proposal/\">proposed the revamp</a> back in February and more than 15 contributors have helped out with the project.</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/pressthis-revamped-with-a-new-user-interface-and-minimalist-design/oldpressthis\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OldPressThis.png?fit=500%2C500\" class=\"attachment-large\" alt=\"Old PressThis\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/pressthis-revamped-with-a-new-user-interface-and-minimalist-design/newpressthis\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NewPressThis.png?fit=500%2C500\" class=\"attachment-large\" alt=\"New PressThis\" /></a>\n\n<p>As you can see from the screenshots above (old PressThis on the left and new PressThis on the right), PressThis has a new user interface and minimalist design. Post meta boxes are replaced with menus that slide from left to right when clicked. The post editor has the bare essential formatting buttons and the add media button is in the bottom left corner.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NewPressThisWithContent.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41517]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41529\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NewPressThisWithContent.png?resize=1025%2C857\" alt=\"New PressThis With Content\" /></a>New PressThis With Content\n<p>When you select PressThis on a post or page, the title, source, and highlighted content will automatically be inserted into the editor. If the article uses images, you&#8217;ll see a list of ones to choose from below the post title.</p>\n<p>Although images are initially inserted using a URL, they&#8217;re automatically uploaded to the local WordPress media library once a post is published or saved as a draft. Not only is this a convenient feature, but it also prevents <a title=\"http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlinking\" href=\"http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlinking\">hot linking</a>.</p>\n<p>While testing PressThis, I found it to be fast and a pleasure to use. If you plan on using it as your primary post editor, keep in mind that it doesn&#8217;t have a way to add featured images. It&#8217;s possible this will be added in a future version.</p>\n<h2>PressThis is More Than Just a Bookmarklet</h2>\n<p>While using PressThis, I discovered that it&#8217;s more than just a bookmarklet; it&#8217;s also an experimental post editor. It gives the core team a chance to experiment with different content authoring approaches without interrupting the core experience.</p>\n<p>George Stephanis, who is one of the project&#8217;s contributors, says PressThis could potentially turn into a multi-blog browser extension.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0\">@jeffr0</a> As it\'s primarily an api consumer, it can also be turned into a multi blog browser extension.</p>\n<p>&mdash; George Stephanis (@daljo628) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daljo628/status/584086709597405184\">April 3, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the biggest drawbacks to PressThis is that you can&#8217;t use it to publish to multiple sites. Arestad says the ability to switch sites is on the roadmap. With the ability to switch sites, PressThis could turn into a closely tied third-party blogging application tailored exclusively for WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/daljo628\">@daljo628</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0\">@jeffr0</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephdau\">@stephdau</a> Allowing site switching is an eventual goal. :)</p>\n<p>&mdash; Michael Arestad (@michaelarestad) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelarestad/status/584088583666995201\">April 3, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m excited about what the future holds for PressThis. It&#8217;s been neglected for years, but it could turn into one of the most useful parts of WordPress.

Sometimes members are too lazy to upload a profile photo, no matter how many friendly prompts you try to offer.</p>\n<p>Missing profile images makes for ugly directory pages and less colorful BuddyPress widgets. It makes it seem like users aren&#8217;t invested enough in your site to bother with having an avatar. A widespread lack of avatars has a subtle damaging effect on both members and non-members&#8217; perceptions of your community.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Brajesh Singh, owner of <a href=\"http://buddydev.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyDev</a>, created the <a href=\"http://buddydev.com/plugins/bp-force-profile-photo/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress Force Profile Photo</a> plugin.

Trying to visit any other page will result in being redirected back to the profile photo upload page at:</p>\n<p><code>/members/[username]/profile/change-avatar/</code></p>\n<p>If the user then deletes his profile photo and doesn&#8217;t add a new one, the plugin will detect that there is no photo and will restrict access to the site again.</p>\n<p>Forcing users to add a profile photo is a drastic measure, but for some communities it might be the only thing that works.

Anyone can now go to Linode or Digital Ocean and fire up their own VPS (Virtual Private Server) within half a minute, for a fraction of the approximately $30 cost of the most basic, one-WordPress-installation package from a specialist WordPress host. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The VPS user can then use Docker or a similar technology to instantly install all they need for any number of secure, optimized installations of WordPress, all running with more memory, storage and bandwidth. The dirty secret of the specialist WordPress hosting industry: this is exactly what most of them are doing themselves.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>If specialized WordPress hosts rely on cloud infrastructure services like Amazon Web Services and charge a premium to customers, what stops Amazon from providing a great managed WordPress hosting experience, thereby eliminating the middleman? As MacGloinn points out, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have already made moves to provide the best out-of-the box experience.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">Just last Friday, Google announced Google Cloud Launcher, enabling push-button deployment of over 120 top Open Source applications, including WordPress, to the Google Cloud Platform. Just two days before that, Microsoft launched the Azure App Service, which does essentially the same thing from a slightly different angle.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>VPS (Virtual Private Servers) and other technical jargon is scary to a lot of people, but if companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft can provide a great out-of-the box experience and charge a significantly lower price compared to specialized hosts, it&#8217;s possible the managed WordPress hosting space could disappear.</p>\n<p>The article has a <a title=\"http://www.wpmayor.com/the-end-of-the-web-hosting-industry/#comments\" href=\"http://www.wpmayor.com/the-end-of-the-web-hosting-industry/#comments\">few comments</a> from readers and offers a lot of food for thought, but I really want to hear from those who own and operate specialized WordPress hosting companies.

Their qualitative analysis, titled <a href=\"http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~mlw/pubs/icwsm2014-favouriting.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">More than Liking and Bookmarking? Towards Understanding Twitter Favouriting Behaviour</a>, dissects the various motivations for using the feature:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The survey responses from these users demonstrate that motives for favouriting tweets are extremely heterogeneous and not always consistent within and between users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although many other apps and websites have offered favoriting for years, this study on Twitter favoriting was one of the first to reveal just how complex and nuanced the feature can become in the hands of users.</p>\n<h3>Add Favorites to WordPress Posts</h3>\n<p>Favoriting is a subjective activity that is interpreted purely by individual motivation. The simple act of pushing a button results in a myriad of functional and communicative uses, making it one of the more interesting interactive features that you can add to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>Favoriting capabilities are especially important when it comes to custom post types. Not every site needs this feature, but it is particularly helpful for those with large amounts of content stored in custom post types, such as books, recipes, movies, jobs, or real estate listings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/favorites/\" target=\"_blank\">Favorites</a> is a new plugin that was released last month on WordPress.org. It is easy for end users to set up but was also created with developers in mind. The plugin provides an API for adding a favorite button to any post type.</p>\n<p>The Favorites settings panel allows you to select the post types where you want favoriting functionality to apply. You can also customize the button text in order to make it suitable for bookmarking, liking, favoriting, or any other similar use.</p>\n<p>Favorites will automatically add a favorite button at the top or bottom of your posts. The button intuitively takes on the styles of your active theme, as you can see in this example with the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/hew-a-free-wordpress-blogging-theme-inspired-by-ryu\">Hew</a> theme:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/favorite-button-on-post.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40043]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/favorite-button-on-post.jpg?resize=837%2C504\" alt=\"favorite-button-on-post\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41485\" /></a></p>\n<p>Use of the plugin requires WordPress version 3.8+ and PHP version 5.3.2+. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kylephillips\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle Phillips</a>, author of Favorites, summarized the features to include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use with Any Post Type</strong> &#8211; Enable or disable favorite functionality per post type while automatically adding a favorite button before and/or after the content. Alternatively, you can use the included functions to display the button anywhere in your template.</li>\n<li><strong>Available for All Users</strong> – Don&#8217;t want to hide functionality behind a login? Favorites includes an option to save anonymous users&#8217; favorites by either Session or Cookie. Logged-In users&#8217; favorites are also saved as user meta.</li>\n<li><strong>Designed for Developers</strong> &#8211; Favorites works great out of the box for beginners, but a full set of template functions unlocks just about any sort of custom functionality developers may need. Favorites outputs the minimum amount of markup needed, putting the style and control in your hands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Phillip set up the <a href=\"https://favoriteposts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">favoriteposts.com</a> site to house documentation for the plugin, including options, settings, available shortcodes, and a function reference for outputting the button, favorite counts, and a list of user favorites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/screenshot-3.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40043]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/screenshot-3.png?resize=900%2C726\" alt=\"screenshot-3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41495\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering if Favorites is compatible with your caching solution, the short answer is &#8216;yes,&#8217; according to the plugin&#8217;s FAQ page:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, although the buttons may display the incorrect state momentarily. Button states are updated via an AJAX call after page load in order to accommodate cached pages. This may be noticeable on slower servers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After having tried many different post bookmarking plugins for WordPress, I found Favorites to be the easiest one to use with the most intuitive button display. If you want to test the plugin without installing it, try out a live demo on <a href=\"https://favoriteposts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">favoriteposts.com</a>.

More than 700 participants gathered in London to share knowledge and experiences surrounding PHP and related web technologies.</p>\n<p>WordPress community members <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miss_jwo\" target=\"_blank\">Jenny Wong</a> and <a href=\"http://aaron.jorb.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Jorbin</a> both spoke at the conference and the videos have just been released today. During Wong&#8217;s keynote presentation, titled &#8220;Integrating Communities,&#8221; she told the story of how she learned PHP by attending local user groups, asking questions, and embracing the community. Her session encouraged those in attendance to build bridges between technology communities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<p>Wong came to WordPress from the PHP community and her presentation addressed the friction that is often present between the two. I spoke with her about the inspiration behind her topic and the deeper issues underlying the general lack of understanding between the two communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lots of people have used WordPress when it was young &#8211; maybe before all the beautiful UI came in,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am not one of those people, but I&#8217;ve heard the stories of how bad the UX was.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some people learned to live with it and became part of the WP community; some people hated it and left. The people who left have a particular ideal of WordPress from their very old experience and unless we as a community reach out to them, their perceptions will not change.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She believes that WordPress contributors should strive to attend and speak at non-WordCamp conferences to learn from and experience other communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Inside the WP community I often hear, &#8216;How do you become better at PHP?&#8217; <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">We need to show them that the WP community is welcomed by the PHP community and that it is not a scary place</span>,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>The situation is gradually improving across many events, as ZendCon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zendcon/status/583638815237087232\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that it will be including a WordPress track. WordPress community members made an effort to attend <a href=\"http://world.phparch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PHP World 2014</a>, PHP developer <a href=\"http://www.lornajane.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Lorna Jane Mitchell</a> spoke at WordCamp London, and PHP South West (a user group in the UK) recently had a joint night with the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Bristol-WordPress-People/\" target=\"_blank\">Bristol WordPress People</a> user group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing more and more of this cross pollination, at least between the WP and PHP community, slowly,&#8221; Wong said.</p>\n<h3>Venturing Outside the WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>Speaking at WordCamps is an excellent way to give back and connect with others in the community, but the value of venturing outside of the WordPress bubble is often overlooked. Aaron Jorbin attended the PHP UK conference knowing only one person.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think there is a personal benefit in putting ourselves in situations we aren&#8217;t automatically comfortable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m used to knowing a lot of people at events. Knowing only one person before hand helps me do a better job of empathizing with people that feel like outsiders at WordPress events. <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">If we want to do a better job of creating diversity, it&#8217;s good to feel the problems people feel when they don&#8217;t feel like they belong.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jorbin spoke on Modernizing the WordPress Toolbox. His presentation goes far beyond the topic of modernizing WordPress&#8217; build tools to include his passion for removing barriers to contributing to the project. Jorbin also delved deeper into the reasons behind the project&#8217;s selection of certain tools.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;We as a community need to do a better job of both getting out there and bringing people in,&#8221; Jorbin said.  &#8220;This is something that we have improved over the last few years (Nacin keynoting PHP Tech, Joe Dolson and Joseph O&#8217;Connor at CSUN, Mel Choyce, Nacin and myself at OS Bridge, etc.), but we have a long way to go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Currently, going outside of the WordPress space usually means that you will encounter some negative opinions about WordPress. Jorbin said that these are largely born out of a lack of knowledge of WordPress and why contributors make the decisions that they make.</p>\n<p>&#8220;PHP developers hear things like PHP 5.2 as a minimum and write us off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When they hear that 1) We run just fine on PHP 5.6, and 2) are already running our automated tests on php7, and 3) that we do it based on our user focused philosophies, they understand it and actually gain a lot of respect for us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beyond combating negative opinions of the software, Jorbin believes that the WordPress community can find a wealth of knowledge outside of WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another benefit is hearing how other projects are solving problems helps WordPress solve problems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hearing about <a href=\"http://drupalladder.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Drupal Ladder</a> influences how I think about on-boarding new contributors. Hearing about how Etsy started using HHVM helps me get ideas for rolling out HHVM on WordPress sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you make the effort to venture outside of your usual networks, you will undoubtedly encounter situations wherein your skills of diplomacy and bridge-building will be sharpened, as both Wong and Jorbin found at the PHP UK conference. However, the value gained in connecting with other communities far outweighs the challenges. The WordPress community has a great deal to share with the world, but it is also enriched by other technologies.</p>\n<p>If you already speak at multiple WordCamps per year, here&#8217;s a new challenge for 2015: Speak at a conference outside the WordPress bubble where you may not know many people.

The new theme, designed by <a href=\"http://soakingupthelight.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ola Laczek</a>, was inspired by <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/themes/ryu\" target=\"_blank\">Ryu</a>, a classic among personal blogging themes. Ryu was released two years ago and for awhile it seemed like everyone was using it.</p>\n<p>Hew brings that same clean, identity-focused design that features the author&#8217;s Gravatar at the top with posts directly beneath. The ability to immediately brand the blog for yourself is one of the design aspects that made Ryu such a hit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41372]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew.png?resize=880%2C660\" alt=\"hew\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41381\" /></a></p>\n<p>Laczek explained her inspiration for Hew in an interview with the <a href=\"http://themeshaper.com/2015/03/31/hew/\" target=\"_blank\">ThemeShaper</a> blog:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ryu was my initial inspiration for Hew. I wanted to create a personal-blogging theme which shows an author’s identity – via Gravatar logo and social media links in the header – while staying focused on their content.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The theme includes one optional custom menu in the top bar, which is displayed to the left of the social links menu. Hew keeps the focus on content by hiding all four of its widget areas within a slide-out top panel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-top-widgets.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41372]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-top-widgets.png?resize=640%2C284\" alt=\"hew-top-widgets\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41388\" /></a></p>\n<p>As is the case with virtually every other recent theme release from WordPress.com, Hew includes support for post formats. The theme prominently features post format icons at the top of every post. Each format has its own subtle differences in style.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-quote-post-formats.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41372]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-quote-post-formats.jpg?resize=986%2C421\" alt=\"hew-quote-post-formats\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41392\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hew&#8217;s customizer options include the ability to change the header image from your Gravatar to something else, as well as the ability to customize the background and header text color. If you&#8217;re hoping to be able to change the yellow highlight color used throughout the theme, I didn&#8217;t see an easy option to do this.

When he found out about WordCamp Belgrade getting approved, he decided to offer his help to Milan Ivanović and the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of creating our own Wapuu several times in the past, but it wasn&#8217;t until I read your article on <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/scott-evans-on-designing-the-punk-wapuu-for-wordcamp-london-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Evans&#8217; punk Wapuu</a> that I finally decided to do something about it,&#8221; Aleksić said. &#8220;I sat down with my colleague <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/milica_spasojevic\" target=\"_blank\">Milica</a>  and created Wapuujlo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wapuujlo&#8217;s attire represents a melding of Serbian tradition with the WordPress mission of democratizing publishing. Aleksić explained his inspiration for the mascot&#8217;s design:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The hat šajkača, a traditional Serbian hat worn by the common folk back in the day, was a logical choice because it represents the people using WordPress to have their voices heard. The plum was Milica&#8217;s idea &#8211; it&#8217;s our national symbol, representing prosperity and unity. These two ideas gave Wapuujlo a traditional vibe, which is a nice contrast to the futuristic/anime variants of the Japanese Wapuu. Even the name Wapuujlo is a nod to traditional Serbian names.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Aleksić found the wapuu SVG file to be easy to alter and the team was able to perform the changes in under five minutes. &#8220;I expect that Belgrade, London, and Philly wapuus will prompt other WordPress communities to come up with their own versions of the mascot,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just don&#8217;t go overboard with the alterations: keep it clean, simple and recognizable,&#8221; Aleksić advised those who want to design a wapuu mascot for an event.</p>\n<p>The trend of creating custom mascots for WordCamps seems to be rapidly catching on outside of Japan. The first edition of WordCamp Belgrade is a historic event for <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/a-glimpse-into-serbias-rapidly-growing-wordpress-community\" target=\"_blank\">Serbia&#8217;s WordPress community</a> and the organizers wanted to offer a commemorative wapuu sticker as part of the branding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to continue the tradition and inspire other WordCamps out there to include Wapuu as a must,&#8221; Ivanović said. &#8220;I just love that cute little fellow!&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Apr 2015 00:14:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: How to Use LICEcap to Record and Turn Screen Captures into Animated GIFs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=41316\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-use-licecap-to-record-and-turn-screen-captures-into-animated-gifs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3800:\"<p>When I wrote about <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/enhanced-plugin-installs-axed-from-wordpress-4-2\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/enhanced-plugin-installs-axed-from-wordpress-4-2\">enhanced plugin installs being removed</a> from WordPress 4.2 last week, a few readers asked how I created the animated image that shows how shiny updates work. I used <a title=\"http://www.cockos.com/licecap/\" href=\"http://www.cockos.com/licecap/\">LICEcap</a> by Çockos Incorporated, which is free, GPL licensed software available for Windows and OSX.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LicecapFrame.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41316]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41321\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LicecapFrame.png?resize=648%2C508\" alt=\"LICEcap Frame\" /></a>LICEcap Frame\n<p>LICEcap has an adjustable frame that you place over the content you want to record. You can adjust the frame manually by dragging the edges with your mouse cursor, or you can type in an exact size. You can also adjust the max frames per second, but keep in mind that the higher the number, the larger the file size will be.</p>\n<p>When you hit the record button, you&#8217;ll be prompted to name the file and select where it will be saved. There&#8217;s also configuration settings that allow you to manipulate the recording.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingSettings.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41316]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41322\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingSettings.png?resize=660%2C222\" alt=\"Recording Settings\" /></a>Recording Settings\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what most of the options do and LICEcap doesn&#8217;t have any documentation outside of <a title=\"http://forum.cockos.com/forumdisplay.php?f=44\" href=\"http://forum.cockos.com/forumdisplay.php?f=44\">this discussion forum</a>. I recommend checking the box to use Control + Alt + P to pause the recording. This way, you won&#8217;t see the mouse cursor move off the screen to click the pause button. LICEcap doesn&#8217;t have an editor to manage frames so if you make a mistake, you&#8217;ll have to start over. Since animated GIFs should be as short and small as possible, the lack of a frame editor isn&#8217;t a big deal.</p>\n<p>Once everything is configured, click the save button and a three second countdown begins. When the countdown reaches 0, LICEcap begins recording movement within the frame. On the bottom left of the recording window, you&#8217;ll see the size of the frame, timestamp, and the amount of FPS.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingWindow.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41316]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41323\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingWindow.png?resize=693%2C557\" alt=\"Recording Status \" /></a>Recording Status\n<p>Once you&#8217;re satisfied with the recording, upload the GIF file to the WordPress media library. When you insert it into a post, make sure to use the full size image since animated GIFs don&#8217;t scale as well as JPG files.</p>\n<h2>A Few Tips When Creating Animated GIFs</h2>\n<p>Keep the recording as short and small as possible. Resize the recording window so it&#8217;s only as big as necessary. Animation such as scrolling and page browsing should be kept to a minimum. Last but not least, play with the recording options as there might be a combination that decreases the file size of recordings.</p>\n<p>Animated GIFs are great for a few laughs, but they&#8217;re also an excellent way to show how something works. They&#8217;re a great option when using video doesn&#8217;t make sense.

The session should make it onto WordPress.tv sometime soon, but in the meantime he created a screencast for those who couldn&#8217;t attend.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://jacklenox.com/2015/03/30/building-themes-with-the-wp-rest-api-wordcamp-london-march-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> is actually an extended edition of his talk and runs for a full 50 minutes. Lenox starts by answering the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal about the REST API?&#8221; He also demos the speed of getting content from the API using a few live examples.</p>\n<p>His presentation offers theme developers a few reasons for why they may want to look into building themes that use the WP REST API:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides a way to retrieve pure data (usually in JSON or XML format) over HTTP</li>\n<li>No loops necessary</li>\n<li>Good for mobile apps and environments where you don&#8217;t want a full webpage to render but want content from a blog or site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lenox gives a basic overview of what can you do with the WP REST API, even without knowing any PHP. The benefits he cites include a more engaging user experience, potentially reduced server load, improved speed, and better control over failed connections. During the presentation he shows examples of how to incorporate single page application elements into WordPress themes where interactions are handled by JavaScript.</p>\n<p>The Picard theme that he demos is aptly named as a play on the next generation of themes. It&#8217;s a prototype WordPress theme built with React and the upcoming WP-API. If you want to play with it, you can clone the repository on <a href=\"https://github.com/jacklenox/picard-present\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. Automattic is aiming to open source the Picard theme around the beginning of May.</p>\n<p>Interest surrounding the presentation demonstrates how excited the WordPress community is to start incorporating the new API into their projects. Many who attended the session at WordCamp London were inspired to start looking at themes in a new way.</p>\n<p>The resulting experience of pre-loading all the content allows users to zip around without any delay. It&#8217;s a dramatic improvement and an amazing example of how a theme can have much more control over the speed and resources needed to present content on the frontend.

The new designations allow users to relinquish all forms of copyright on images. The move is in response to requests from its community and recognizing it has become an important repository of U.S. Government works and historical content.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ve been proud to support Creative Commons licenses since 2004, and we’ve become an important repository of U.S. Government works and historic images from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums around the world (check out <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/commons\">The Flickr Commons</a> for examples).</p>\n<p>But we’ve heard from our community that we’re missing two important designations: Public Domain and Creative Commons 0 (CC0). Many members of our community want to be able to upload images that are no longer protected by copyright and correctly tag them as being in the Public Domain, or they want to release their copyright entirely under CC0.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a title=\"http://www.spacex.com/\" href=\"http://www.spacex.com/\">SpaceX</a> is the first <a title=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacexphotos\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacexphotos\">Flickr account</a> to change its image designation to CC0.

Flickr only provides four different search filters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any License</li>\n<li>Creative Commons Only</li>\n<li>  Commercial use allowed</li>\n<li>  Modifications allowed</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LackofSearch.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41269]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41274\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LackofSearch.png?resize=1025%2C423\" alt=\"Lack of Search Filters\" /></a>Lack of Search Filters\n<p>Since CC0 is mixed in the other Creative Commons license types, it&#8217;s difficult to search only for images with the CC0 and Public Domain designations. Until Flickr adds specific license filters to its search box, users will likely spend more time searching for images instead of using them.</p>\n<p>Despite not being able to easily find them, enabling users to waive all copyright protection on photographs should increase the amount of freely available images to use. This is a huge win and in the future, could make Flickr the largest source of Public Domain images on the web.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Apr 2015 01:24:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"Post Status: How StoryCorps uses WordPress to enable storytelling everywhere\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=12142\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://poststatus.com/how-storycorps-uses-wordpress-to-enable-storytelling-everywhere/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10814:\"<p><a href=\"http://storycorps.org/\">StoryCorps</a> is an organization that aims &#8220;to provide people of all backgrounds and beliefs with the opportunity to record, share and preserve the stories of our lives.&#8221; Featured stories are broadcast nationally on NPR.</p>\n<p>StoryCorps has published more than 50,000 interviews with almost 100,000 participants since they launched in 2003.

The stories tend to be very powerful. I was nearly brought to tears by one where <a href=\"https://storycorps.me/interviews/i-just-hugged-the-man-who-murdered-my-son/\">a lady hugs her son&#8217;s murderer</a>. Another moving story (from my hometown no less), features a father that <a href=\"http://storycorps.org/listen/william-watford-iii-and-deidra-robinson/\">comes to terms with his daughter&#8217;s homosexuality</a>. Or there&#8217;s one where President Obama<a href=\"http://storycorps.org/listen/noah-mcqueen-and-barack-obama-150225/\"> interviews a boy who overcame adversity to join My Brother&#8217;s Keeper</a>.</p>\n<h3>Record stories anywhere</h3>\n<p>The latest initiative for creating ways for people to share their story is via <a href=\"https://storycorps.me\">StoryCorps.me</a>, a website and companion apps that make it easy for anyone with a smartphone to record an interview and publish it.</p>\n<p>StoryCorps.me is built on WordPress, and utilizes the <a title=\"The WordPress REST API\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-json-rest-api/\">WordPress REST API</a> to enable access to a customized content architecture. The StoryCorps app utilizes the API to consume data and publish stories from the app back to the website.</p>\n<p>I interviewed Dean Haddock, Director of Digital &amp; Technical Innovation at StoryCorps, about how the idea for the app came about, how they use and think of WordPress, and other insights from their short three month development period.</p>\n<p>Listen to the interview:</p>\n<a href=\"https://audio.simplecast.fm/9832.mp3\">https://audio.simplecast.fm/9832.mp3</a>\n<p><a href=\"https://audio.simplecast.fm/9832.mp3\">Direct Download</a></p>\n<h3>A national day of listening</h3>\n<p>Dean says he thinks the StoryCorps app really dates back to a program they ran three years ago called A National Day of Listening, where instead of shopping on Black Friday, they hosted an event where people could tell stories.</p>\n<p>Dean&#8217;s team expanding on the idea, and the event turned <a href=\"http://diy.storycorps.org/\">into a micro-site</a> using SoundCloud&#8217;s API that made that process easier. That project eventually expanded into the idea that would become StoryCorps.me.</p>\n<h3>Funding for the app</h3>\n<p>The StoryCorps app was funded thanks to StoryCorps founder Dave Isay winning this year’s TED Prize, with a substantial amount of research and development conducted under the 2014 Knight Foundation Prototype Award. He gave a TED Talk in Vancouver just a few weeks ago, where he shared how <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en\">everyone has a story to tell</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12145\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en\"><img class=\"wp-image-12145 size-large\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/dave-isay-752x391.png\" alt=\"Dave Isay at TED\" width=\"752\" height=\"391\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dave Isay at TED</p></div>\n<blockquote><p>The TED Prize is awarded to an individual with a creative, bold vision to spark global change. By leveraging the TED community’s resources and investing $1 million into a powerful idea, each year the TED Prize supports one wish to inspire the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize\">- TED Prize website</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>His wish after winning the TED Prize was to &#8220;to grow this digital archive of the collective wisdom of humanity.&#8221; During the TED Talk, he noted that StoryCorps is &#8220;the single largest collection of human voices ever collected.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new app makes this mission even more plausible, by having almost no barrier for interview creation. The $1 million TED Prize made it possible.</p>\n<h3>Development of the StoryCorps app</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12146\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/storycorps-app-752x444.jpg\" alt=\"storycorps-app\" width=\"752\" height=\"444\" /></p>\n<p>With &#8220;one tap&#8221;, interviews can be created and uploaded to the StoryCorps.me website and the Library of Congress archive.</p>\n<p>Dave shared some of his vision for the app during the TED Talk:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id=\"t-1069355\" class=\"talk-transcript__fragment\">Imagine, for example, a national homework assignment</span> <span id=\"t-1073093\" class=\"talk-transcript__fragment\">where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country</span> <span id=\"t-1077087\" class=\"talk-transcript__fragment\">records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving,</span> <span id=\"t-1079989\" class=\"talk-transcript__fragment\">so that in one single weekend</span> <span id=\"t-1082892\" class=\"talk-transcript__fragment\">an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Development of the app was managed on three levels.</p>\n<p>The StoryCorps team did project management, communication, and handled RFPs for app and website development. They also ensured that everything fit the StoryCorps model, and ensured that the new website and app talked to existing StoryCorps software and APIs properly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://10up.com\">10up</a> built the website infrastructure, manages scalability issues, and managed the integration of the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://maya.com/news/maya-creates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanityreates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanity\">MAYA design</a> designed and built the app for the end-user, utilizing PhoneGap so that the app could be launched simultaneously to both iOS and Android platforms.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote alignright\">&#8220;We knew we going to use WordPress before we started looking for partners to help us build this thing.&#8221;</span> As a &#8220;small to midsize non-profit,&#8221; StoryCorps has few resources. StoryCorps.org has been on WordPress, and they wanted to use WordPress for StoryCorps.me as well.</p>\n<p>The development phase was quite short: from funding to launch took only three months. They launched at TED after receiving the funding last October.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For public facing web technology, WordPress is so flexible and so malleable and amenable to whatever we need to do with it, that it really wasn&#8217;t much of a question whether this was the right platform.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What their real question was, Dean shares, was how WordPress could scale if and when they hit a million users, and that&#8217;s why they brought in 10up.</p>\n<h3>What they learned</h3>\n<p>They are really pleased with how the project has gone so far. However, not everything was a success. They had to pivot and make adjustments as they went along and learned new things and requirements.</p>\n<p>Dean noted, <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">&#8220;You have to be willing to completely submit to the process.&#8221;</span> He says it wouldn&#8217;t have succeeded if 10up and Maya weren&#8217;t committed as StoryCorps to the success of the project.</p>\n<p>They also learned what Dean calls &#8220;more tangible&#8221; things, like the usage of PhoneGap. Without using a tool like PhoneGap, they wouldn&#8217;t have been able to &#8220;get to market as soon as possible.&#8221; However, he admits the app could be slightly better if it were built in a native platform to either iOS or Android.</p>\n<h3>Powerful stories</h3>\n<p>I really enjoyed digging into StoryCorps mission and the new <a href=\"https://storycorps.me\">StoryCorps.me</a> project. I&#8217;m addicted to their stories, and some of the stories that have been uploaded &#8212; such as <a href=\"https://storycorps.me/interviews/krisalyn-cut-her-hair/\">those</a> <a href=\"https://storycorps.me/interviews/grandmas-favorite-memories/\">in</a> the audio intro &#8212; are really endearing.</p>\n<p>While there may be an element of noise to the StoryCorps.me archive, it&#8217;s already evident that many gems will emerge, and who knows what ideas people will come up with for creative ways to perform interviews and record stories.</p>\n<p>The apps are available on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bottlerocketapps.storycorps\">Google Play</a> and in the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/storycorps/id359071069?mt=8\">App Store</a>.

Preliminary stats and feedback indicate that the directory improvements have had a positive impact on users&#8217; ability to hunt for themes.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org contributor Konstantin Obenland <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/31/theme-directory-stats/\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that user engagement has taken a significant jump:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Users stay longer on the site, look at a lot more pages, and are way less likely to leave without any interaction. Comparing the week before the relaunch with this past week, session duration is up 9%. The amount of pages a user looks at is up 34%. And the overall bounce rate went down from ~30% to under 10%. Even on the homepage, where the bounce rate was at around 45%, we can see that drop by 2/3.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The new design has not affected the directory&#8217;s search engine ranking or download numbers. Obenland states that visitor numbers remain constant, as do search engine referral numbers and theme downloads.</p>\n<p>While the new image-heavy grid design makes it easier for users to find the best themes on WordPress.org, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/commercial/\" target=\"_blank\">Commercial Themes</a> page has suffered a sharp decline in stats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Commercial Themes page saw a drop of ~40% in visitors between the old Directory and the new,&#8221; Obenland said. &#8220;That number was at 60% right after launch, but it recovered and continues to recover with some adjustments we made to the link placement on the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the prominent placement of &#8220;Commercial Themes&#8221; link on the main theme directory page, users are spending more time browsing for free themes. The previous design of the directory made it tedious to search for a new theme, but it&#8217;s likely that the new UI is helping users to discover how many truly beautiful, high quality free themes are available on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The Commercial Themes page received the same UI updates as the main directory, but the chief complaint from commercial theme developers following the design switch was the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/947\" target=\"_blank\">placement and labeling of the link</a>. This particular aspect of the design has been iterated upon several times since the launch.</p>\n<p>However, relentlessly pursuing better stats for commercial theme shops is contrary to the purpose of the WordPress theme directory, according to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design#comment-65597\" target=\"_blank\">an email reply</a> received by one concerned user who contacted themes@wordpress.org:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal wouldn’t be to maximize traffic to the sites listed on the commercial page so much as making the site as functional and useful as possible,&#8221; the WordPress.org representative stated.</p>\n<p>The commercial themes link has ultimately received an even more prominent placement than it had in years past and is also benefiting from the updated design. If stats remain down, it&#8217;s possible that the new design better reflects the quality of the free themes available. Satisfied users are less likely to turn to commercial options when they can easily browse and filter free options. For now, commercial theme shops listed in the directory will have to settle on improving their marketing elsewhere.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 20:30:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: What’s a Better Name for the Happiness Bar?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=41227\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"http://wptavern.com/whats-a-better-name-for-the-happiness-bar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5129:\"<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WPHappinessBarFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41227]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41246\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WPHappinessBarFeaturedImage.png?resize=817%2C368\" alt=\"WP Happiness Bar Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/35800266@N07/9265175419\">WPMTL2013happinessbar_13_LR</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve <a title=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\">attended a WordCamp</a>, you might be familiar with the term <em>Happiness Bar</em>. It&#8217;s an area within a WordCamp venue devoted to providing technical support for WordPress. Morten Rand-Hendriksen thinks it&#8217;s time to <a title=\"http://mor10.com/it-is-time-to-rename-the-happiness-bar/#.VRmrv4e3rqk.twitter\" href=\"http://mor10.com/it-is-time-to-rename-the-happiness-bar/#.VRmrv4e3rqk.twitter\">change the name</a> to something more obvious.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The most important task of giving a service a name is to ensure the name communicates what the service does to the uninitiated. The problem, which is pretty obvious, is that the name “Happiness Bar” says nothing about what is being provided. The name “Happiness Bar” is more befitting a bar where they hand out cotton candy, hugs, or free jokes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Like Hendriksen, I have observed WordCamp attendees not take full advantage of the happiness bar, mostly due to not knowing what it is. It also doesn&#8217;t help when WordCamp organizers fail to mention it during opening remarks. Happiness is a subjective term and is delivered differently depending on the person. This is evident in the responses Hendriksen received when he asked attendees what the happiness bar is.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Is it where they hand out swag?”</li>\n<li>“It’s a place where they give you life advice?”</li>\n<li>“It’s a desk where they have life/business/happiness coaches?”</li>\n<li>“You go there to get a massage?”</li>\n<li>“Do they give away candy?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As someone who has attended several WordCamps, I find their responses comical yet, realistic. Within the comments of Hendriksen&#8217;s post, <a title=\"http://mor10.com/it-is-time-to-rename-the-happiness-bar/comment-page-1/#comment-1361772\" href=\"http://mor10.com/it-is-time-to-rename-the-happiness-bar/comment-page-1/#comment-1361772\">Jen Mylo gives insight</a> into how the happiness bar originated.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the historical reason it was called that: It used to be Genius Bar and at SxSW an Apple person came over, smiled, and took a picture, and we were afraid we’d get sued. WCSF was coming up soon and all of the natural names like WP Help Desk etc had independent businesses attached to them, and we didn’t want to have a conflict with any small businesses.</p>\n<p>Back when Automattic ran WCSF (vs a .org community team like now), happiness bar made sense for that one event, because they were mostly Happiness Engineers and it didn’t infringe on anyone’s business. After that, other WCs wanted to copy it. I begged them not to, to just call it a help desk or something, but organizers persisted in wanting to adopt that nomenclature to be more like SF. (I didn’t use it at the WCs I organized in NYC or Savannah.)</p>\n<p>I work for Automattic so I obviously think it’s a good company, but the devotion to that name in other contexts has always bummed me out, because it doesn’t mean a damn thing to anyone unless they have already been indoctrinated with the whole &#8216;focus on happiness, not support, because the happy outcome is what we want to provide&#8217; thing, which almost no one has.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mylo finished her comment by offering feedback on Hendriksen&#8217;s suggestions for a new name and encouraged him to post his idea to the <a title=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community\" href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community\">Make WordPress Community</a> site to start a more official conversation.</p>\n<h2>Call The Happiness Bar The WordPress Help Center</h2>\n<p>I think the happiness bar should be renamed to something that&#8217;s generic and easy to figure out based on its title alone. My suggestion is to call it the <em>WordPress Help Center</em>. It tells people it&#8217;s a location within the venue and is a place to get WordPress help. It&#8217;s also generalized so that it covers both WordPress.com and WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The only issue I see is that, <a title=\"http://wphelpcenter.com/\" href=\"http://wphelpcenter.com/\">WP HelpCenter</a> used to be a service that offered WordPress tech support. However, the site and service has been defunct for a long time. Perhaps the <a title=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/\" href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/\">WordPress Foundation</a> can find a way to obtain the domain so the title can be used at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>Do you think it&#8217;s time to rename the happiness bar to something else? If so, let us know what you would call it and why.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 19:56:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Behind the Curtain with DerpPress, WordPress’ Anonymous Satirical Twitter Account\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=41207\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"http://wptavern.com/behind-the-curtain-with-derppress-wordpress-anonymous-satirical-twitter-account\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11270:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/derppress.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41207]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/derppress.png?resize=1025%2C473\" alt=\"derppress\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41217\" /></a></p>\n<p>For the past two years, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DerpPress/\" target=\"_blank\">DerpPress</a> Twitter account has been cranking out tweets to amuse followers with clever puns and subtle commentary on WordPress news and development.

At the risk of putting his/her seemingly never-ending fountain of puns in jeopardy, do we really want to know DerpPress’ real identity?</p>\n<p>As part of our continual quest to find out who is behind the account, the Tavern reached out to DerpPress for an interview. Below are unedited answers to some of our burning questions and perhaps even a few clues pointing towards the mysterious voice behind the account.</p>\n<p><strong>1. When you created the DerpPress account, what was on your mind? Did you simply hope to have a few laughs? Or were you thinking, &#8220;WordPress needs its own satirical twitter account.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Much more of the former than the latter. As I recall, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wphoneybadger\" target=\"_blank\">WP Honey Badger</a> was rather active back when I started the DerpPress account, so it wasn&#8217;t as though the WP community lacked for snarky subtweets. It wasn&#8217;t any sort of stated mission or anything &#8212; I primarily started it out as a way to gently rib bad WordPress coding practices and missteps (usermeat and such) and honestly it just evolved from there.</p>\n<p><strong>2. On Aug 2nd last year, you tweeted from what I can only assume was WordCamp NYC. To whom did you reveal yourself? How many people are aware of your true identity?</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"http://t.co/eOvMkN5Inu\">pic.twitter.com/eOvMkN5Inu</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; DerpPress (@DerpPress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DerpPress/status/495617532704083969\">August 2, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yup, WCNYC. One person guessed it there. As for other folks who have acknowledged knowing it&#8217;s me: I know of one definite, two that I&#8217;m pretty sure have me nailed and another two who claim to know but I&#8217;m betting are guessing wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What other WordCamps have you attended?</strong></p>\n<p>Quite a few.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What do you think of WordPress competitors like Ghost?</strong></p>\n<p>Ghost minus the hype is intriguing, but I think its reliance upon Node.js is the real short-term killer for competing against WP. It&#8217;s just not possible at this stage to find a decent shared host that will let you run Node, so it&#8217;s either self-hosting or expensive &#8220;professional&#8221; tier hosting (leaving aside their own hosted solution). It&#8217;s really hard to compete against WP&#8217;s simplicity and low, low, LOW system requirements.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve looked into Bolt a bit, I&#8217;ve always kept at least an eye on Drupal and Joomla!, and a few of the static site generators (Leeflets, Jekyll, etc.). While I like Markdown as much as the next web copywriter, those options are still a bit too fiddly for the mass market. My noodling-about shared hosting accounts are littered with the likes of Xoops, concrete5, MODx, Melody, Habari, heck, even a Textpattern install or two.</p>\n<p>WordPress is innovating, though, and in a way that many folks seem blind to &#8212; the WP-API. The intriguing part of the WP-API is that it will (theoretically) allow multiple other projects to either integrate existing WP installs into their flow or to dramatically &#8220;re-skin&#8221; WordPress. You could potentially have a Ghost-like dashboard, completely free of WP&#8217;s legacy, all driven off the API. It&#8217;s pretty exciting.</p>\n<p>Also, I miss having MovableType around to kick about.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Do you think that John O&#8217;Nolan characterized you unfairly in his post on <a href=\"http://john.onolan.org/open-source-culture/\" target=\"_blank\">open source culture</a>? Can you respond to his claims? Would you identify yourself as an open source cultural influencer?</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Conversely, it’s sad to see a sometimes disparate culture in the WordPress core community. Anonymous twitter accounts like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordPreh\" target=\"_blank\">WordPreh</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DerpPress\" target=\"_blank\">DerpPress</a> spend all day, every day, mostly cutting down other people and projects. It’s like a niche version of Secret app. Regular ad hominem snark directed at people both inside and outside the WordPress community.&#8221;</em> &#8211; O&#8217;Nolan</strong></p>\n<p>An influencer? I certainly hope not.</p>\n<p>I think O&#8217;Nolan really misses my point. I know that there are lots of WP ecosystem ex-pats tooling about, some with axes to grind, but I do appreciate the ones who take the time to say &#8220;This is what I see is wrong with WP and here&#8217;s some constructive feedback&#8221;.</p>\n<p>That being said, the WordPress community can occasionally exhibit behavior best described as &#8220;hero worship&#8221;. It&#8217;s honestly a great thing for &#8220;rockstars&#8221; to make themselves available, but too often we find ourselves venerating folks for their position. I definitely subtweet a good deal and I really try not to take myself too seriously. I hope others do the same. This is all good-natured ribbing. (Except for when we take shots at Joomla!. Those are deadly serious.)</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s occasionally bouts of That&#8217;s Not Funnyism that runs rampant. I suggest a mild dose of Everyone Calm Down And Laugh A Bit.</p>\n<p><strong>6.

Ever.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Can you recommend some strategies for becoming a better WordPress professional?</strong></p>\n<p>See point #6. But in general: you should be attending Meetups and WordCamps, making connections, following interesting WP people on Twitter (and clicking the links they share), and working with WP in your spare time, if ever you have any. The best way to get better at anything WP is to practice, and to pay attention.</p>\n<p>Also: build a time machine and go back and study WordPress&#8217; history from the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Who would make a good replacement for Matt Mullenweg to lead WordPress and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Interesting question. I hear Steve Ballmer may have some free time on his hands as of late and&#8230;</p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p>Oh. Well, it might be interesting if the respective heads of WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla! each took a year and a half and headed one of the other projects &#8212; Matt could head Joomla!, Dries could do WordPress, and, hmmm, I&#8217;m not sure who leads J!, but they could take Drupal.

His new plugin works alongside caching solutions, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Super Cache</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/batcache/\" target=\"_blank\">Batcache</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/\" target=\"_blank\">W3 Total Cache</a>, to enable WordPress to better serve cached pages to logged-in users.</p>\n<p>Jaquith knows just about everything there is to know about site optimization and caching techniques in WordPress. He recently gave a presentation at <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-london-2015-highlights-the-energy-in-the-uk-wordpress-scene-with-punk-wapuu-and-a-focus-on-non-profits\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp London 2015</a>, entitled “<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/markjaquith/cache-money-business\" target=\"_blank\">Cache Money Business</a>” where he debuted the new plugin.</p>\n<p>He introduced Cache Buddy as &#8220;a companion for your WordPress page caching solution.&#8221; Ordinarily, when WordPress is serving pages to logged-in users or those with comment cookies, it cannot cache pages, even with popular caching plugins in place. Cache Buddy steps in to fill in the gap, allowing WordPress to serve a cached page to logged-in users by performing the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Changes what paths logged-in cookies are set for (so they work in the WordPress backend, but don’t exist on the front of the site).</li>\n<li>Sets custom cookies with relevant information about the logged-in user, on the front of the site, making these cookies JavaScript-readable.</li>\n<li>Sets custom cookies for commenters (again, JavaScript-readable), and doesn’t set the normal WordPress comment cookies.</li>\n<li>Uses the information from these JavaScript cookies, plus some comment form magic, to recreate the comment form experience users would get from a dynamic page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By cutting down on the number of dynamic views (cache misses), the load on your sever is dramatically decreased. The toolbar will be hidden from Subscriber and Contributor users, but Authors, Editors, and Administrators will still see the toolbar and get dynamic views.</p>\n<p>Cache Buddy is ideal for sites that already have a caching solution in place and get lots of traffic but have no strict requirements on providing dynamic views. Jaquith summarized the kinds of sites for which Cache Buddy will not be useful:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you have a BuddyPress site or an e-commerce site, you may honestly need WordPress logged-in cookies available on the front of your site. But if you’re just running a blog/CMS site with a significant number of commenters and logged-in Subscribers, this plugin could massively speed up your site, because requests that had to always be dynamic before, can now be served from a page cache.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-buddy/\" target=\"_blank\">Cache Buddy</a> is available to download for free from WordPress.org. To learn more about how it works, check out Jaquith&#8217;s <a href=\"https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/cache-buddy/\" target=\"_blank\">post introducing the plugin</a>, as well as his <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/markjaquith/cache-money-business\" target=\"_blank\">slides</a> from WordCamp London 2015.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 04:07:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Post Status: Andrew Nacin has joined the White House’s U.S. Digital Service\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=12083\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://poststatus.com/andrew-nacin-has-joined-the-white-houses-u-s-digital-service/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6238:\"<p>Andrew Nacin hasn&#8217;t worked at <a href=\"http://audrey.co/\">Audrey Capital</a> since January. At Audrey, he has worked for more than four years for WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg, exclusively on the WordPress project. He has <a href=\"http://nacin.com/2015/03/29/us-digital-service/\">joined the White House’s new U.S. Digital Service</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service\">The U.S. Digital Service</a> is a new organization that operates from the White House, with an aim to modernize and transform the way the federal government operates digitally.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I was approached, I have to admit that I was nervous to step back from the day-to-day buzz of WordPress because I’ve invested so much. But the community stepped up, in most cases not even knowing about my life change. That’s the beauty of open source, and the fantastic WordPress community in particular. WordPress continues to play an important role in my life. With <a href=\"http://ma.tt\">Matt Mullenweg</a>’s support and encouragement, I’m taking time away from Audrey, where I’ve worked since 2010. I’m still actively involved in the project, just not full time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Those that are aware of WordPress core development and Nacin’s role in it, know that he’s enormously influential on the project. He’s lead developer for WordPress and has worked full-time or more than full-time exclusively on WordPress for years. He lead WordPress 3.5, 3.7, and 3.9 in a span of two years. In 2014, Nacin spent a lot of time on security related projects, and he&#8217;s always been heavily involved in a variety of WordPress.org website projects.</p>\n<h3>The year of delegation</h3>\n<p>Nacin spent much of 2014 attempting to make himself replaceable. No software project is healthy if there is one person that is so indispensable that if they were no longer involved the project would be severely burdened.</p>\n<p>From security, to internationalization efforts, to leading releases, to managing the WordPress.org website, Nacin has altered his role throughout the year to empower other contributors to do the type of work he was doing.</p>\n<p>His transfer to the U.S. Digital Service just happened to be good timing with this effort. The perfect testament is that he’s been working full time with the U.S. Digital Service since January and the large majority of the WordPress core development community has had no idea.</p>\n<p>Some may be concerned about what happens without Nacin full time on core. The answer is that “business as usual” will happen, and is already happening.</p>\n<h3>About the U.S. Digital Service</h3>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote alignright\">Members of the U.S. Digital Service come from all over the country and some of the top tech companies in the world.</span> Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are among them. They work on small teams and embed into troubled federal projects to help test, triage, and transform them to success. Wired has a great in-depth article on <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/08/healthcare-gov/\">how the organization works</a>. The team was established in the wake of the Healthcare.gov disaster, and they’re taking the success they had fixing Healthcare.gov across the government.</p>\n<p>Nacin is on one of these teams, and it’s hard to imagine a more perfect fit. Those that follow him <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin\">on Twitter</a> or know him in person can see his passion for government. He also lives in DC and has friends in various parts of government.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s my nature to look for the hardest problems to solve. I like to take on big challenges and spend every ounce of energy working to solve them. I believe in what we’re doing here. The stakes are high. No matter the challenge, I know what we’re doing will change millions of lives.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>A changing role</h3>\n<p>He’ll be away from Audrey for his stint in government. At some point, he may come back to Audrey and resume his work. It’s actually a preferred method of employment for many members of the U.S. Digital Service. Many of the team members are leaving lucrative jobs to work for the government, which has many restrictions that had to be overcome.</p>\n<p>They even <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/08/the-white-house-dickerson/\">make exceptions on how they dress</a>. The program is designed for members of the U.S. Digital Service to have flexible employment, where they work for six months, or maybe a year, and then they return to the private sector. They may even rotate into the U.S. Digital Service multiple times.</p>\n<p>In his <a href=\"http://nacin.com/2015/03/29/us-digital-service/\">announcement post</a>, Nacin advocates for others to consider <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service#section-join\">joining the U.S. Digital Service</a>. I think it would be incredible if more WordPress developers were involved at that level of government, and it would be a further testament to open source&#8217;s standing in the government community &#8212; a sector that was slow to adopt open technology but now is doing so regularly.</p>\n<p>WordPress lead developers are not always full time on WordPress. Mark Jaquith has never been full time on the project. It is more important that they can guide the project, but being a lead developer doesn’t mean writing code for WordPress every day. It means steering the ship, and that’s what Nacin and the other lead developers do day to day.</p>\n<p>I’m really excited for Nacin, and I think it’s great for the project. The amount he will learn and engage with the U.S. Digital Service will make him an even better WordPress lead developer. The U.S. Digital Service is also one of the most exciting government initiatives I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about his decision to join <a href=\"http://nacin.com/2015/03/29/us-digital-service/\">on his blog</a>, and learn more about the U.S. Digital Service <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service/\">on their website</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://kldn.net\">Vladimir Petkov</a></em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 17:56:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Andrew Nacin: I’ve joined the White House’s U.S. Digital Service\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"http://nacin.com/?p=4297\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"http://nacin.com/2015/03/29/us-digital-service/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6125:\"<blockquote><p>The need for effective government services is rising, while confidence in our ability to deliver them is dropping.

From my home in D.C., I&#8217;ve closely watched <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/\">open data</a> and <a href=\"https://m.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/06/02/ostp-s-own-open-government-plan\">open government efforts</a>. <a href=\"http://nacin.com/2014/03/24/an-hour-to-make-government-better/\">I feel very strongly</a> about an open, transparent, and efficient government — boosted in no small part by WordPress and open source.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve long admired a number of my new teammates, especially <a href=\"http://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2015/03/meet-digital-service-guru-whos-helping-new-recruits-navigate-federal-bureaucracy/107148/\">Erie Meyer</a>, <a href=\"http://apieconomist.com/blog/2013/4/10/6h6gntzp6twfuw4zwrzu0j43u0o80p\">Gray Brooks</a>, and <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2014/12/02/getting-started-at-usds.aspx\">Haley van Dyck</a>, for years of tenacity and hard work trying to change government from the inside out. <span>I&#8217;ve always felt I could be more effective helping government from the outside, by continuing to work on WordPress. </span><span>After all, we&#8217;ve all heard horror </span><span>stories of all sorts of red tape, from hiring to procurement and everything in between. And we&#8217;ve all heard how difficult government itself makes it to launch good government digital services. While many of us may have have wanted to help, few thought they could. Fewer knew how.</span></p>\n<p>But then the U.S. Digital Service was formed, from <a href=\"http://wired.com/2014/08/healthcare-gov/\">the team that helped rescue healthcare.gov</a>. It&#8217;s dedicated to tackling some of government&#8217;s most pressing problems, ones that directly affect millions of people&#8217;s lives.<strong> </strong>The formula is simple: take what helped turn around healthcare.gov and <a href=\"http://playbook.cio.gov\">apply it</a> to other high priority projects across government.</p>\n<p>In this day and age, public policy must be backed by effective technology to succeed. The American people need our help and our government has asked us to serve, as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service#section-join\">doers and makers, creative thinkers, and specialized technologists dedicated to untangling, rewiring, and redesigning our government</a>.</p>\n<p>In January, I joined the U.S. Digital Service.</p>\n<p>When I was approached, I have to admit that I was nervous to step back from the day-to-day buzz of WordPress because I&#8217;ve invested so much. But the community stepped up, in most cases not even knowing about my life change. That&#8217;s the beauty of open source, and the fantastic WordPress community in particular. WordPress continues to play an important role in my life. With <a href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>’s support and encouragement, I&#8217;m taking time away from Audrey, where I&#8217;ve worked since 2010. I&#8217;m still actively involved in the project, just not full time.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Digital Service is the real deal. I&#8217;ve been astounded by the impact we&#8217;ve already made. We&#8217;ve recruited <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/03/19/president-obama-names-david-recordon-director-white-house-information-technology\">some</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/04/white-house-names-googles-megan-smith-the-next-chief-technology-officer-of-the-united-states/\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/20/day-one-mikey-dickerson-us-digital-service-administrator\">the</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/18/white-house-names-dr-dj-patil-first-us-chief-data-scientist\">best</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/05/next-us-chief-information-officer\">and</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/why-i-joined-the-u-s-digital-service-24c6682afce2?source=latest\">brightest</a>. Don&#8217;t just take my word for it — do what you can to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/mikey-dickerson-to-sxsw-why-we-need-you-in-government-f31dab3263a0\">learn more about this movement</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/us-digital-service\">come help us make government better</a>. If you haven&#8217;t seen <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service\">this video</a> yet, take a look. (A few of you have noticed me in the background.)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s my nature to look for the hardest problems to solve. I like to take on big challenges and spend every ounce of energy working to solve them. I believe in what we&#8217;re doing here. The stakes are high. No matter the challenge, I know what we&#8217;re doing will change millions of lives.</p>\n<p>I thought I had made the most of my decade in D.C. I&#8217;ve witnessed a lot of history. I knew I&#8217;d have some great stories to tell my future kids and grandkids. <em>I was there. I saw it.</em> That was only the beginning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"share-sfc-stc\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2FpQEdq-17j&count=vertical&related=nacin&text=I\'ve joined the White House\'s U.S. Digital Service\" class=\"twitter-share-button\"></a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 17:25:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Andrew Nacin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: US memory championship.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44786\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://ma.tt/2015/03/us-memory-championship/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:486:\"<blockquote><p>To attain the rank of grand master of memory, you must be able to perform three seemingly superhuman feats.

According to Slack, the breach occurred during a four-day period in February.</p>\n<p>Hackers gained access to a central database used to store user names, email addresses, and one-way encrypted (“hashed”) passwords. In addition, the database contains information that users may have optionally added to their profiles such as phone number and Skype ID.</p>\n<p>Slack uses <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt\">bcrypt</a> with a randomly generated salt per-password that according to Slack, &#8220;makes it computationally infeasible that your password could be recreated from the hashed form.&#8221; No financial data was compromised and so far, the company hasn&#8217;t found any evidence that the hackers were able to decrypt the stored passwords.</p>\n<h2>Two New Security Options</h2>\n<p>Slack has launched two new features for individuals and team owners to help increase security. The first is <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_authentication\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_authentication\">Two-Factor authentication</a>. Slack has a <a title=\"https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204509068\" href=\"https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204509068\">detailed guide</a> that explains how to configure 2FA for your account. When you enable 2FA, you&#8217;ll be prompted to enter a verification code in addition to your normal password whenever you sign in.</p>\n<p>The second is a “<a title=\"https://my.slack.com/admin/auth#password_reset\" href=\"https://my.slack.com/admin/auth#password_reset\">Password Kill Switch</a>” for team owners. The kill switch allows for instantaneous team-wide resetting of passwords and forced termination of all user sessions for all team members. This means that everyone is signed out of your Slack team, in all apps and on all devices.</p>\n<h2>Enable 2FA Where Possible</h2>\n<p>Users are highly encouraged to enable 2FA on Slack and on any other service that supports it.

However, enhanced plugin updates will remain in WordPress 4.2.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NewPluginUpdateRoutine.gif\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41191]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41064\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NewPluginUpdateRoutine.gif?resize=837%2C688\" alt=\"New Plugin Update Routine\" /></a>New Plugin Update Routine\n<p>It&#8217;s uncommon for functionality to be removed from WordPress this late in the development cycle. Drew Jaynes, who is <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/drew-jaynes-to-lead-wordpress-4-2\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/drew-jaynes-to-lead-wordpress-4-2\">leading the 4.2 release cycle,</a> explains that the feature just isn&#8217;t ready.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Prudence demands that we decide whether to do things now vs do things right. In this case, we want to make sure we handle the user experience of activating plugins after installation the right way for most use cases. So we still have &#8216;Shiny Updates&#8217;, but we&#8217;re going to have to fall back and regroup on &#8216;Shiny Installs&#8217;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the Make WordPress core blog, <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/03/25/dev-chat-agenda-march-25-2015/#comment-25391\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/03/25/dev-chat-agenda-march-25-2015/#comment-25391\">Aaron Jorbin outlined three issues</a> caused by auto activating plugins.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Plugins that require after activation steps (such as connecting to Jetpack or Google Analytics, updating permalinks for BuddyPress, etc) aren’t obvious.

The documentation for the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/principles/\" target=\"_blank\">Principles of Site Design on Web Fundamentals</a> is also a great resource with practical suggestions for making your site better for mobile users.</p>\n<p>Google also created a mobile-friendliness <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/website-software/wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">guide specifically for WordPress users</a>. It encourages site admins to update to the latest version of WordPress and to use a theme that that is mobile-friendly.</p>\n<p>If you want to test your site on various mobile devices, the Google Chrome browser has a “<a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode\" target=\"_blank\">mobile device emulation</a>” feature that can be found under the &#8220;Developer Tools&#8221; menu.</p>\n<h3>Find a Responsive WordPress Theme</h3>\n<p>Out of the 3,000+ themes listed on in the official directory, filtering by &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/responsive-layout/\" target=\"_blank\">Responsive Layout</a>&#8221; under &#8220;Features&#8221; currently returns only 947 themes. This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that 2/3 of themes hosted on WordPress.org are not responsive. These are simply the ones that have been tagged with &#8220;Responsive Layout.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/03/18/mobile-friendly-themes/\" target=\"_blank\">posted a notice</a> about the update to encourage developers to examine their themes for mobile-readiness ahead of time. If your theme is not responsive, Emil Uzelac suggests adding responsive media queries:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mobile-Friendly can be a Responsive design, but also an App that turns your theme into a “mobile version”.</p>\n<p>Since we don’t accept themes with mobile Apps because that would fall into a plugin territory, our choice is Responsive and media queries instead of browser sniffing tools.</p>\n<p>Now, for the mobile-friendliness, responsive media queries will be enough and that is the very basic to be qualified as “mobile-friendly”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not all WordPress.org theme developers will be willing to update their themes with a responsive layout, as some of them are abandoned and no longer maintained. If your theme is failing Google&#8217;s mobile friendly test, the most important change you can make is to update to a theme with a responsive layout. Even if site ranking and SEO are not important to your objectives, improving the experience for mobile users should be enough motivation to make the change.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 01:16:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: HeroPress Publishes its First Essay “Finding Your Place” by Andrey Savchenko\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=41151\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"http://wptavern.com/heropress-publishes-its-first-essay-finding-your-place-by-andrey-savchenko\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1889:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/heropress.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41151]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37733\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/heropress.jpg?resize=956%2C423\" alt=\"heropress\" /></a>Despite not hitting his <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/heropress-fails-to-attract-backers-cancels-kickstarter-campaign-ahead-of-deadline\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/heropress-fails-to-attract-backers-cancels-kickstarter-campaign-ahead-of-deadline\">funding goal of $60k</a>, Topher DeRosia took the feedback and support he received and <a title=\"http://heropress.com/heropress-rising/\" href=\"http://heropress.com/heropress-rising/\">moved forward</a> with the <a title=\"http://heropress.com/\" href=\"http://heropress.com/\">HeroPress project</a>.

The project is led by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Bachhuber</a>, currently the interim director of engineering at <a href=\"http://fusion.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Fusion</a>, the company where Shortcake originated.

Developers who want to utilize Shortcake can register a UI for their shortcodes alongside add_shortcode, which will expose Shortcake&#8217;s user-friendly interface.</p>\n<p>Shortcake transforms your ordinary shortcode to render a preview in a TinyMCE view:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shortcake-demo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40867]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shortcake-demo.png?resize=1025%2C538\" alt=\"shortcake-demo\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41115\" /></a></p>\n<p>It also supplies a user-friendly UI to add shortcodes via the &#8220;Add Media&#8221; button.

It has been retooled using an MVC architecture that relies on Browserify. Shortcake contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeetu_58\" target=\"_blank\">Jitendra Harpalani</a> explains the reasons behind the changes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Specifically, we decided to use Browserify. It’s much easier to compartmentalize models, views, and controllers into different directories and then simply “require” them into your main JavaScript file, rather than having to create a self-contained and fully-fledged Backbone app.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fortunately, WordPress core already uses Browserify to split apart the media library JavaScript, so it doesn&#8217;t introduce a new dependency.</p>\n<h3>Does Shortcake have a chance to make it into WordPress core?</h3>\n<p>Although shortcodes make it easy to insert and structure complex content, they&#8217;re an eyesore in the post editor. Including multiple shortcodes the old fashioned way can quickly become messy.</p>\n<p>Shortcake is a well-conceived solution that brings new life to shortcodes and makes them significantly less confusing to implement. Contributors on the project believe in it enough to start working on the steps necessary to make the feature plugin ready to be proposed for core.</p>\n<p>If it does land in core someday, it will be interesting to see how well the feature is adopted. If some developers register a UI for their shortcodes and others don&#8217;t, it could be confusing to know which shortcodes are available if they don&#8217;t show up on the &#8220;Insert Element&#8221; screen. Then again, that problem already exists without Shortcake. Without the help of an additional plugin, there&#8217;s no easy way to know which shortcodes are available.</p>\n<p>If you think Shortcake has potential and want to get involved, follow the updates on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/shortcode-ui/\" target=\"_blank\">make.wordpress.org/core</a> and join the development team for a meeting on WordPress.org Slack.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 10:59:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"Matt: Why Remote Work Thrives in Some Companies and Fails in Others – HBR\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44883\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://ma.tt/2015/03/why-remote-work-thrives-in-some-companies-and-fails-in-others-hbr/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:854:\"<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/why-remote-work-thrives-in-some-companies-and-fails-in-others\">Why Remote Work Thrives in Some Companies and Fails in Others</a>, by Sean Graber in the Harvard Business Review.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Why are some organizations reaping benefits but others not?

Advances in technology are keeping pace. About 94% of U.S. households have access to broadband Internet — one of the most important enablers of remote work.

Despite the costs associated with maintaining <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/\">Pods</a>, it&#8217;s remained free of charge since the day it was created. In September 2011, Pods lead developer, Scott Kingsley Clark, created a <a title=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sc0ttkclark/pods-development-framework-20\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sc0ttkclark/pods-development-framework-20\">Kickstarter campaign</a> asking for $1,500 to help fund Pods 2.0 development. By the time it ended, he received $4,177 with 91 backers.</p>\n<p><a title=\"http://pods.io/2015/03/24/help-us-grow-introducing-friends-of-pods/\" href=\"http://pods.io/2015/03/24/help-us-grow-introducing-friends-of-pods/\">According to Clark</a>, sponsorship money from Automattic and donations from users are just enough to keep the support team going with little left over to put towards website and plugin development. In what may be a first for a WordPress plugin, Clark has launched a &#8220;<a title=\"https://pods.io/friends-of-pods/\" href=\"https://pods.io/friends-of-pods/\">Friends of Pods</a>&#8221; funding campaign that works similar to public television.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PodsCampaignMissionStatement.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41076]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41084\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PodsCampaignMissionStatement.png?resize=1025%2C444\" alt=\"Friends of Pods Mission Statement\" /></a>Friends of Pods Mission Statement\n<p>There are <a title=\"https://pods.io/friends-of-pods/membership-levels/\" href=\"https://pods.io/friends-of-pods/membership-levels/\">four tiers</a> to choose ranging from $5-$300 per month. Each tier has perks and benefits including, shirts, stickers, tweets, and placement on the Pods website. You can also donate a one time amount or become a pillar sponsor. Those who donate $25 a month or more are eligible to choose rewards every six months, which are provided by reward partners.</p>\n<p>The funding will be used to decrease private development of Pods and focus more on Pods core, related plugins, and integrations.

Meta is 87% and all others are above 50% (Comments: 67%, Users: 60%, Posts: 54%). According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelbaker\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Baker</a>, one of the lead developers on the project, said the team is shooting for >80% on the &#8216;develop&#8217; branch.</p>\n<p>Version 1.2 adds handling for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) OPTIONS requests, request hijacking, better errors, and a slew of bug fixes. This release received contributions from 29 people, and the full <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/releases/tag/1.2\" target=\"_blank\">changelog for 1.2</a> is available on GitHub.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer who is currently using the WP REST API in one of your projects, you may be wondering about compatibility for updating to 1.2.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some internal functions were deprecated, but compatibility impact is really minor,&#8221; Baker said. All of these changes are noted in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/releases/tag/1.2\" target=\"_blank\">changelog</a> under &#8220;Deprecation warning&#8221; or &#8220;Compatibility warning.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Next for Version 2.0 of the WP REST API?</h3>\n<p>Version 1.2 is the last stop on the 1.x branch of the plugin. &#8220;We’ve been working hard over the past four months, with the aim of releasing a beta for version 2.0 next month,&#8221; Baker said in her release post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For existing code written for version 1.x we will issue a final 1.x release as a compatibility shim to seamlessly connect existing code to version 2.0.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Developers are eager to find out when the WP REST API will land in WordPress core. There&#8217;s no set timeline, but the next release cycle of the plugin is geared toward polishing it up for prime time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The #1 goal of v2.0 is to merge into WP core,&#8221; Baker told the Tavern. In <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/  https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/03/24/wp-rest-api-version-1-2/#comment-25383\" target=\"_blank\">reply</a> to a commenter inquiring about the time table, she said, &#8220;The timeline for that is &#8216;sometime in 2015.&#8217; Our goal is to make the WP REST API too impressive to refuse.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Version 2.0 development will focus on the following highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Route versioning and namespacing (for future core updates and plugins)</li>\n<li>Reducing the code to create custom endpoints</li>\n<li>Overall implementing feedback we received on version 1.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The WP REST API team has outlined a <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/571\" target=\"_blank\">Core Merging Plan for the API</a>.

Fancy updates for themes will be added in a future release and will continue to use the classic update/install routine. You can follow the progress by watching tickets <a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31529\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31529\">31529</a> and <a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31530\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31530\">31530</a>.</p>\n<p>During testing, I was able to install 10 plugins in under a minute. Removing friction from the update and install process not only saves mouse clicks, but it&#8217;s a great user experience. In fact, the process is so quick, it might make sense to add a visual indicator that tells the user a plugin is installed. For instance, when a plugin is installed, a notification model window would pop up and fade away.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to try shiny updates for yourself, install <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2015/03/wordpress-4-2-beta-2/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2015/03/wordpress-4-2-beta-2/\">WordPress 4.2 beta 2</a> on a test site.

You can see the post <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/happytables-exits-beta-wants-restaurant-websites-to-quit-sucking/#.VRGJ-xDF-3g\">I wrote about them</a> then. They&#8217;ve matured a lot since that time, investing more into products, finding their footing from a sales perspective, and expanding their team.</p>\n<p>Human Made has a products team of six people, including some WordPress back-end development heavyweights. The new Happytables 3 is built using a custom REST API to make it unrecognizable from WordPress, though it&#8217;s built completely on WordPress. Ryan McCue, who is leading the official <a title=\"The WordPress REST API\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-json-rest-api/\">WordPress REST API project</a>, is lead on the Happytables API as well.</p>\n<p>The new Happytables dashboard is catered directly to restaurant owners. It simplifies much of the decision making for theming, utilizing a single standard template and offering customization options through a front-end editor and available content blocks.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12014\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ht-customize-752x498.jpg\" alt=\"ht-customize\" width=\"752\" height=\"498\" /></p>\n<p>The end result of the customizer is a mobile-centric website that&#8217;s catered quite well to common restaurant tasks. They cite that over 50% of their current traffic is mobile, and they have made every effort to make the mobile experience on Happytables websites good.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12015\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ht-mobile-752x376.png\" alt=\"ht-mobile\" width=\"752\" height=\"376\" /></p>\n<p>Editing restaurant-centric content like menus is straightforward.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12012\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ht3-752x466.jpg\" alt=\"ht3\" width=\"752\" height=\"466\" /></p>\n<p>I spent about half an hour on the Happytables site yesterday, exploring the platform and starting a restaurant website for a friend of mine. I was impressed with how far the product has come from a usability standpoint, answering the questions I had, as I encountered them.</p>\n<p>Noel Tock, who is a partner at Human Made and runs products, has spent a lot of time talking to and pitching restaurant owners. <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">They&#8217;ve invested years into research and the first iterations of the platform, and they were able to build Happytables 3 with more real customer insights than ever before.</span> The research shows, both in the UX and the impressive integration options; they offer integrations with menu, reservation, and reviews services that cater to Europe and the United States.</p>\n<p>They also make it as simple as possible to sign up. The first question is to type your restaurant name or address, and they auto-import as many details as they can.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12021\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/signup-ht1.gif\" alt=\"signup-ht\" width=\"600\" height=\"256\" /></p>\n<h3>Goals and milestones for Happytables</h3>\n<p>Happytables has been successful so far, but in ways different than you may first assume.</p>\n<p>Human Made has two deals for white-labeled versions of Happytables currently. They are an exclusive partner with <a href=\"http://www.iens.nl/\">IENS</a>, a directory platform in the Netherlands that was acquired by TripAdvisor. Also, they provide US-based online ordering service <a href=\"https://www.chownow.com/\">ChowNow</a> with a white-labeled version of Happytables.</p>\n<p>Current and past deals like these have been both profitable and educational for Human Made.</p>\n<p>Restaurant growth is a different beast than partnerships. Individual restaurants also often require 1:1 sales, a service the Happytables team offers up. The hard part isn&#8217;t convincing them Happytables is a good option, it&#8217;s assuring them that there is, &#8220;someone on the other end of the line,&#8221; as Noel Tock once put it to me. These restaurant owners can&#8217;t get very good (human) support with more mainstream providers like Wix or Squarespace.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote alignright\">Human Made would like to see 5,000 new paying customers on the Happytables platform between now and the end of the year.</span> They are pouring most of their product resources into the project, making a big bet on Happytables and its potential in the restaurant website market.</p>\n<p>As for current websites they host, I don&#8217;t know the exact numbers and they aren&#8217;t sharing them publicly. But they do state that they are serving close to 1 million pageviews per month from the restaurants they already host.</p>\n<h3>Targeting Squarespace and Wix</h3>\n<p>Happytables isn&#8217;t targeting other WordPress centric solutions, or even other restaurant website builders. When they talk to restaurant owners on sales calls, they discover that their competition is most often the likes of Squarespace and Wix &#8212; other hosted options, but not restaurant specific.</p>\n<p>Restaurants, while not the only market for such hosted options, is a big niche for them. Happytables wants to take it away, and they know they can only do that by offering a far superior product. With <a href=\"http://www.happytables.com\">Happytables</a>, they hope to <em>wow</em> restaurant owners with something they&#8217;ve never seen before.</p>\n<p>I know when I used it yesterday &#8212; despite some minor quirks (that they were already working on) &#8212; I came away incredibly impressed. <a href=\"http://www.happytables.com/pricing/\">At $39 a month</a>, I went ahead and sent the demo URL to my friend who is opening a restaurant. We&#8217;re having lunch on Thursday, when he&#8217;ll sign up for his account. It&#8217;s exactly the kind of thing he was hoping for, so he can get back to working on his restaurant and not worry about his website.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 17:09:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Joseph: WordPress Upgrades &gt; MySQL Upgrades &gt; PHP Upgrades\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://josephscott.org/?p=11646\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://josephscott.org/archives/2015/03/wordpress-upgrades-mysql-upgrades-php-upgrades/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2521:\"<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/01/major-update-to-our-version-stats-for-php-mysql-and-wordpress/\">updated</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">WordPress.org stats page</a> shows more than 50% of active sites are on version 4.0 or newer:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://josephscott.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wp-versions.png\"><img src=\"https://josephscott.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wp-versions-300x292.png\" alt=\"wp-versions\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11880\" /></a></p>\n<p>That is really good for a piece of software released less than <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2014/09/benny/\">seven months ago</a>.

This class is typically used to house the content within a WordPress theme. This is a technical step that may prevent some users from properly configuring Lasso, but since the article class varies between themes, it&#8217;s a mandatory step in the setup process.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LassoIntroductionScreen.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40987]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40988\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LassoIntroductionScreen.png?resize=711%2C762\" alt=\"Introduction Screen\" /></a>Introduction Screen\n<p>Lasso has built-in support for several WordPress themes. If you&#8217;re using a supported theme, it will automatically display the correct CSS class to use.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a theme developer and your theme&#8217;s post container is dedicated to content without using any other markup, you should <a title=\"help@lasso.is\" href=\"mailto:help@lasso.is\">send an email</a> to Haskins with your theme&#8217;s text domain and CSS class. He&#8217;ll include support for it within Lasso&#8217;s opening status wizard.</p>\n<p>While trying to locate the article class, I discovered that I couldn&#8217;t close the animated walk through making it impossible to find.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ImStuck.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40987]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40990\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ImStuck.png?resize=1025%2C686\" alt=\"Stuck in Lasso\" /></a>Stuck in Lasso\n<p>While troubleshooting the problem, I deactivated all plugins and determined that one of Jetpack&#8217;s modules was causing the issue. I reactivated each module individually, but was unable to determine which one caused the problem.</p>\n<p>Once I was able to close the walk through, I used Firebug&#8217;s element inspection tool to locate my theme&#8217;s article class. The theme I used to test Lasso is a child theme of Stargazer and its CSS class for content is <strong>.entry-content</strong>. After configuring the article class, I was able to use Lasso on the frontend of WordPress.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ArticleclassSettings.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40987]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40991\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ArticleclassSettings.png?resize=716%2C358\" alt=\"Article Class\" /></a>Article Class\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EditorButtonCSSTrouble.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40987]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40994\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EditorButtonCSSTrouble.png?resize=268%2C82\" alt=\"Missing Two Buttons\" /></a>Missing Two Buttons\n<p>Although Lasso is compatible with many of the most popular themes, I encountered a CSS conflict in my child theme. As you can see from the screenshot, two of the buttons in the editor are displayed at the bottom. I notified Haskins of the issue and after some troubleshooting, we discovered a CSS conflict between my child theme and Lasso.</p>\n<p>The solution is to add <strong>!important</strong> to a specific CSS class, but as Haskins explains, it&#8217;s not an ideal solution:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ensuring that markup styles in Lasso are consistent across all themes is a challenge, especially when it comes to unordered lists. The editor uses semantic markup, with its own margins and paddings. Theme styles will sometimes override this causing un-desired visual issues.</p>\n<p>We can combat this by declaring !important, but this is a bad practice and will just upset developers who want to theme Lasso. In the end, we&#8217;re left with dealing with these issues as they come up through our support channels.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lasso only shows up when viewing the single page view of a post or page. You can edit content already published or use it as the primary editor to create content when previewing a draft post. Lasso&#8217;s main menu has three buttons, edit post, post settings, and add post.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post settings gives you the option to switch the status of a post from draft to publish. You can also change the URL slug.</li>\n<li>Add new post allows you to create a new post.</li>\n<li>Edit post activates the editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Lasso creates a new post, it automatically displays it on the frontend of WordPress. However, you can&#8217;t change the category or tags of a post using Lasso. This is something I&#8217;d like to see added to the post settings as it would come in handy, especially when creating new posts.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CreateNewPostInLasso.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40987]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40992\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CreateNewPostInLasso.png?resize=752%2C650\" alt=\"A New Post Created by Lasso\" /></a>A New Post Created by Lasso\n<p>To edit content, you can either highlight words and click a formatting button or use keyboard shortcuts. One major drawback is that you can&#8217;t add images or media to posts. However, you can edit and manipulate media from the frontend if it&#8217;s already in a post. When I tried to edit an image, the buttons turned into unrecognizable codes.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LassoEditImageWeirdButtons.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40987]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41049\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LassoEditImageWeirdButtons.png?resize=690%2C195\" alt=\"Weird Buttons\" /></a>Weird Buttons\n<p>When editing a post, there are two buttons on the bottom right portion of the screen. Depending on whether it&#8217;s a draft or published post, you&#8217;ll see a save and publish icon. I think these icons are too far away and should be integrated into the editor.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LassoSaveButton.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40987]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41042\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LassoSaveButton.png?resize=1025%2C590\" alt=\"Can You Find The Save Button?\" /></a>Can You Find The Save Button?\n<h2>Wait For Lasso 1.0</h2>\n<p>Lasso is a beta product with plenty of things that need to be addressed before hitting 1.0. Haskins is aware of the issues I encountered and assures me they&#8217;ll be fixed in future versions. Now that it&#8217;s available for purchase, he plans to iterate quickly and release updates as they&#8217;re fixed.</p>\n<p>Lasso is <a title=\"https://lasso.is/pricing/\" href=\"https://lasso.is/pricing/\">$129 for one site</a> and includes 12 months of updates and support. I expect plugins at this price point to be polished and nearly bug free. Although none of the bugs I encountered prevented me from using the editor, I recommend waiting on 1.0 or later.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 14:40:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Scott Evans on Designing the Punk Wapuu for WordCamp London 2015\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=41000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"http://wptavern.com/scott-evans-on-designing-the-punk-wapuu-for-wordcamp-london-2015\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6695:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/punk-wapuu.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41000]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/punk-wapuu.jpg?resize=1025%2C514\" alt=\"punk-wapuu\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41004\" /></a></p>\n<p>On the first day of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-london-2015-highlights-the-energy-in-the-uk-wordpress-scene-with-punk-wapuu-and-a-focus-on-non-profits\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp London 2015</a>, I was meandering around the Happiness Bar when I first noticed the punk wapuu stickers covering the swag table.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;These are so damn cute!&#8221;</em> I muttered out loud. Admittedly, I can&#8217;t get enough of wapuu, and every new variation inspires shrieks of delight. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottsweb\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Evans</a>, an organizer for the event, happened to be within earshot. I asked him if he knew more about how the punk wapuu was created. It turns out that he helped to design the creature&#8217;s punk persona for the event.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/scott-evans.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41000]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/scott-evans.png?resize=256%2C256\" alt=\"scott-evans\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-41002\" /></a>Evans is a WordPress designer and engineer working at Automattic with the WordPress.com VIP team. Prior to that he was part of Code for the People, a company that was <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-code-for-the-people-expands-wordpress-com-vips-reach-into-european-markets\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by Automattic last November</a> in order to expand its reach into European markets.</p>\n<p>As part of the WordCamp London organization team, Evans was tasked with managing the event&#8217;s print and design projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite nice to volunteer at WordCamp, because you get to do print, which I hardly ever get to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You get to see lanyards and your t-shirts come to life when you send them off to print.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Evans&#8217; colleague Simon Dickson suggested doing something with the wapuu. The core organizing team gave Evans feedback on different iterations of the punk wapuu, making it a collaborative effort.</p>\n<h3>The Process of Theming WordCamp London</h3>\n<p>Coming up with a new theme for a WordCamp every year is no easy task, which is why events often maintain the same logo and design concepts. Evans and the other organizers were committed to keeping the design fresh.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last time we did WordCamp London, we had kind of a tube theme going on, the sights of London, using symbolism from the tube maps. This time we wanted something different, a bit of a change. We could have kept with the same logo we had before, but it was time for something new. We latched onto the punk 1970&#8217;s kind of feel &#8211; bright colors, mohicans, and grungy textures.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although the punk scene in the UK has long since died out, WordCamp London was prepared to revive it. Once organizers nailed down the theme, the creative process started to gain momentum. Evans cranked the punk tunes and got to work</p>\n<p>&#8220;I spent a few weeks cutting out WordPress logos, scenes of London, photocopying them and making collages, which we then used to create the t-shirts and banners,&#8221; Evans said.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wcldn-design.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41000]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wcldn-design.jpg?resize=600%2C600\" alt=\"photo credit:  Shayda Torabi\" class=\"size-full wp-image-40960\" /></a>photo credit:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaptora/status/579346108155109376\" target=\"_blank\">Shayda Torabi</a>\n<p>In addition to the commemorative stickers, each attendee went home with a scarf embroidered with the punk wapuu.</p>\n<h3>Customizing Wapuu</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/original-wapuu.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41000]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/original-wapuu.png?resize=273%2C300\" alt=\"original-wapuu\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-41027\" /></a>The <a href=\"http://jawordpressorg.github.io/wapuu/\" target=\"_blank\">wapuu</a> mascot was created by the Japanese WordPress community and released under the GPL v2 or later. The original wapuu lives on <a href=\"https://github.com/jawordpressorg/wapuu\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and is available as an SVG file.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Anyone can take it, download it, and then modify it, which is kind of in the WordPress spirit,&#8221; Evans said.</p>\n<p>While working with the file, he discovered that some of the paths needed fixing, which was the trickiest part. Evans plans to fix those and submit them back to the wapuu repository.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Working with wapuu is actually really easy &#8211; it will open in most graphics programs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just dropped it into illustrator, added a mohican, pierced his ears, and put some Dr. Marten&#8217;s boots on him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Japanese WordCamps generally have a custom wapuu designed for the event, and other WordCamp organizers are starting to get inspired to do the same. WordCamp Philly is actually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilJimmi/status/579666510945214464\" target=\"_blank\">preparing an entire collection of custom wapuu</a>, including one that bears a strong resemblance to Rocky.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rocky-wapuu.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41000]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rocky-wapuu.png?resize=599%2C201\" alt=\"rocky-wapuu\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41032\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Designing WordCamps is actually a hell of a lot of work,&#8221; Evans said. &#8220;There&#8217;s so many things to consider &#8211; t-shirts, printing lanyards with everyone&#8217;s names on them, scarves, volunteer t-shirts, posters, stickers. Producing those assets and sending them to print is an undertaking.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the end, the efforts put into the design pay off when a unified theme emerges to tie the event together. &#8220;My top tip would be to find a theme, something you can have fun with, and then just push that out to all of the things you need to design,&#8221; Evans said.</p>\n<p>Organizers can never overestimate the power of design when it comes to event branding and WordCamp swag. It&#8217;s one of the most important efforts that, when done well, brings delight to attendees and helps to make the event unforgettable.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 08:50:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:10:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 06 Apr 2015 03:58:03 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:14:\"content-length\";s:6:\"206744\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Mon, 06 Apr 2015 03:45:13 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 250\";s:13:\"accept-ranges\";s:5:\"bytes\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20141029120254\";}',	'no'),
